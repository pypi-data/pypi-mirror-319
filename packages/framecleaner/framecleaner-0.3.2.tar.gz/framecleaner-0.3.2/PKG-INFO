Data Cleansing Tool
This project provides a Python script for cleansing data in various file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML). It offers a variety of operations to clean and process your data, including removing null values, handling duplicates, formatting column names, and transforming date columns. Users can choose cleansing operations interactively through a command-line interface.
