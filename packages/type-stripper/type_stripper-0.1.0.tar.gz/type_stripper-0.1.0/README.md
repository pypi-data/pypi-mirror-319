# python-type-stripper

Python package that strips type annotations from a source file,
printing the modified file to stdout.

## Installation

_TBD_

## Usage

_TBD_

## What it does

- Parameter annotations in function definitions are removed:

  ```diff
  - def func(a: int, b: str = "30", c: int = 42, *args: str, **kwargs: dict[str, int]):
  + def func(a, b = "30", c = 42, *args, **kwargs):
  ```

- Return-type annotations are removed:

  ```diff
  - def func() -> str:
  + def func():
  ```

- Annotations in variable assignments are removed:

  ```diff
  - x: int = 10
  + x = 10
  ```

- Bare annotation statements are removed entirely:

  ```diff
  - x: int
  ```

Formatting, comments, and all other syntax remains unchanged.

### What it does not do

Some of the resulting code's format may be stylistically incorrect:

```diff
# Given:
- def foo(a: int = 4):

# Produces:
+ def foo(a = 4):

# What it probably should produce (note the spacing):
+ def foo(a=4):
```

You may wish to run results through a formatter first.

## How?

This package uses [`libcst`](https://github.com/Instagram/LibCST)
to parse the Concrete Syntax Tree of an input module,
then modifies (or removes) nodes in that tree to strip type annotations away.

A similar task could be completed in Python's [`ast`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) module,
however the AST does not preserve code structure or syntax the way CST does.

## Why?

For fun ~~and profit~~. ðŸ™‚

There are some potential use cases, however:

- **Backwards compatibility**:
  Code developed on modern Python versions with type hinting
  may not work on older versions of Python.
  While I would strongly recommend migrating to a more recent version of Python,
  this tool can get code working faster.
- **Other Python variants**:
  Some Python dialects
  (such as [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark))
  may use the same Python syntax, but may not (now or ever) support type annotations.
  This tool can be used to transpile code meant for more "standard" Python flavors
  to work in these environments.
- **Smaller file size**:
  Need to shave precious bytes off a Docker image build
  and your type hints are not relevant to the runtime
  (i.e., not using FastAPI where type annotations are critical)?
  Strip those type hints off to reduce file sizes to their bare minimum.
- **Reduced complexity when teaching**:
  Modern Python code with type annotations may be difficult
  for the newest beginners to comprehend.
  While teaching how data types interact is important,
  some learners may benefit from the reduced noise in their code samples.

Absolutely none of these statements are qualified or tested:
I just sort of made them up.
Take it as you will!

### Setup

To get started, clone this repo locally.

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can take advantage of our [`Brewfile`](Brewfile) to install things as a bundle:

```shell
brew bundle install
```

Otherwise, please installation instructions for each of the following tools:

- [just](https://just.systems/)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

Most other tooling uses our [`Justfile`](Justfile) recipes or standard `uv` commands.
For instance, you can bootstrap the environment by running:

```shell
just bootstrap
```

Run `just` by itself or `just help` to show help docs from the Justfile.

### Code quality

`pre-commit` takes care of most code quality concerns automatically.
Passing pre-commit hooks is a required check in CI,
so it will make your life easier to enable them locally and catch errors early.

To run pre-commit hooks manually, use
[`pre-commit run`](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-run)
with appropriate options.

> [!note]
> For convenience, you can run hooks on all project files by calling `just lint`.
>
> An optional `hook_id` can be used to run a specific hook:
>
> ```shell
> just lint ruff
> # pre-commit run ruff --all-files
> ```

### Testing

We use `pytest`.
There aren't very many tests as of writing, but still. ðŸ™‚

To run the test suite, simply call `just test` (or `uv run pytest`).
Any additional args are passed to `pytest` unchanged:

```shell
just test -k test_selector
# uv run pytest -k test_selector
```

This will run tests on the latest Python version supported by the library.
You can test against all supported versions using `just test-all`
