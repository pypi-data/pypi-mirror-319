    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the functionality of `publish` and `subscribe` using:\n",
    "- Local Mosquitto MQTT broker\n",
    "- The `publish` decorator to send messages in **synchronous** mode\n",
    "- The `subscribe` decorator to process messages in **synchronous** mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, `async_publish` and `async_subscribe` are also implemented, but **not thoroughly tested**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "1. Ensure Mosquitto is installed and running:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   brew install mosquitto\n",
    "   mosquitto\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. Ensure `pycarta` is installed in editable mode (`pip install -e .`) from the root directory of the project.\n",
    "3. A mosquitto subscriber can be set up as follows for testing purposes:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mosquitto_sub -t test\n",
    "   ```"
