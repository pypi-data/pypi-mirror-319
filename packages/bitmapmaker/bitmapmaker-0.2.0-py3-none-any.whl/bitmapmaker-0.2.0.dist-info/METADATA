# bitmapmaker

This is a package that opens a windows GUI in which you can toggle squares on/off as you please (including bulk area selection). Once you submit, it will show you visually in a 2D array what your resulting bitmap looks like, as well as paste the python 2D array into a terminal which you can copy as needed.
