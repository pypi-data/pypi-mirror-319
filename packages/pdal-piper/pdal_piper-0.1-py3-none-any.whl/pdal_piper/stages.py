Expression Syntax
=================

The PDAL expression syntax is a subset of that found in a great many programming languages.
Specifically, it uses a limited set of operators from the C language. Dimension names
can be used where a variable or constant would be used. Double-precision constants are
supported.

All mathematical operations are done with double-precision floating point. There is no
automatic conversion of numeric values to logical values.  For example, the following is
not permitted:

::

  ((Intensity > 0) && Classification)

Instead, you must write:

::

  ((Intensity > 0) && (Classification != 0))

filters.approximatecoplanar
===============================================================================

The **approximate coplanar filter** implements a portion of the algorithm
presented
in [Limberger2015]_. Prior to clustering points, the authors first apply an
approximate coplanarity test, where points that meet the following criteria are
labeled as approximately coplanar.

.. math::

  /lambda_2 > (s_{/alpha}/lambda_1) /&/& (s_{/beta}/lambda_2) > /lambda_3

:math:`/lambda_1`, :math:`/lambda_2`, :math:`/lambda_3` are the eigenvalues of
a neighborhood of points (defined by ``knn`` nearest neighbors) in ascending
order. The threshold values :math:`s_{/alpha}` and :math:`s_{/beta}` are
user-defined and default to 25 and 6 respectively.

The filter returns a point cloud with a new dimension ``Coplanar`` that
indicates those points that are part of a neighborhood that is approximately
coplanar (1) or not (0).

.. embed::

Example
-------

The sample pipeline presented below estimates the planarity of a point based on
its eight nearest neighbors using the approximate coplanar filter. A
:ref:`filters.range` stage then filters out any points that were not
deemed to be coplanar before writing the result in compressed LAZ.

.. note::
    The `assignment` and `condition` options are deprecated and may be removed in a
    future release.

Options
-------

assignment
  A :ref:`range <ranges>` followed by an assignment of a value (see example).
  Can be specified multiple times.  The assignments are applied sequentially
  to the dimension value as set when the filter began processing. [Required]

condition
  A single :ref:`ranges <ranges>` that a point's values must pass in order
  for the assignment to be performed. [Default: none] [Deprecated - use 'value']

value
  A list of :ref:`assignment expressions <Assignment Expressions>` to be applied to points.
  The list of values is evaluated in order. [Default: none]

.. include:: filter_opts.rst

.. _assignment expressions:

Assignment Expressions
======================

The assignment expression syntax is an expansion on the :ref:`PDAL expression` syntax
that provides for assignment of values to points. The generic expression is:

.. code-block::

    "value" : "Dimension = ValueExpression [WHERE ConditionalExpression)]"

``Dimension`` is the name of a PDAL dimension.

A ``ValueExpression`` consists of constants, dimension names and mathematical operators
that evaluates to a numeric value.  The supported mathematical operations are addition(`+`),
subtraction(`-`), multiplication(`*`) and division(`//`).

A :ref:`ConditionalExpression <PDAL expression>` is an optional boolean value that must
evaluate to `true` for the ``ValueExpression`` to be applied.

.. note::
    As of PDAL 2.7.0, assignment to a dimension that does not exist will cause
    it to be created. It will always be created with type double, however.



Example 1
=========

.. code-block:: json

  [
      "input.las",
      {
          "type": "filters.assign",
          "value" : "Red = Red / 256"
      },
      "output.laz"
  ]

This scales the ``Red`` value by 1/256. If the input values are in the range 0 - 65535, the output
value will be in the range 0 - 255.

Example 2
=========

.. code-block:: json

  [
      "input.las",
      {
          "type": "filters.assign",
          "value" : [
              "Red = Red * 256",
              "Green = Green * 256",
              "Blue = Blue * 256"
          ]
      },
      "output.laz"
  ]

This scales the values of Red, Green and Blue by 256. If the input values are in the range 0 - 255, the output
value will be in the range 0 - 65535. This can be handy when creating a :ref:`COPC <writers.copc>` file which
(as defined in LAS 1.4) needs color values scaled in that range.

Example 3
=========

.. code-block:: json

  [
      "input.las",
      {
          "type": "filters.assign",
          "value": [
              "Classification = 2 WHERE HeightAboveGround < 5",
              "Classification = 1 WHERE HeightAboveGround >= 5"
          ]
      },
      "output.laz"
  ]

This sets the classification of points to either ``Ground`` or ``Unassigned`` depending on the
value of the ``HeightAboveGround`` dimension.

Example 4
=========

.. code-block:: json

  [
      "input.las",
      {
          "type": "filters.assign",
          "value": [
              "X = 1",
              "X = 2 WHERE X > 10"
          ]
      },
      "output.laz"
  ]

This sets the value of ``X`` for all points to 1. The second statement is essentially ignored
since the first statement sets the ``X`` value of all points to 1 and therefore no points
the ``ConditionalExpression`` of the second statement.

The color interpolation filter assigns scaled RGB values from an image based on

1. You provide a minimum_ and maximum_, and the data are scaled for the
   given dimension_ accordingly.

2. You provide a k_ and a mad_ setting, and the scaling is set based on
   Median Absolute Deviation.

3. You provide a k_ setting and the scaling is set based on the
   k_-number of standard deviations from the median.

You can provide your own `GDAL`_-readable image for the scale color factors,
but a number of pre-defined ramps are embedded in PDAL.  The default ramps
provided by PDAL are 256x1 RGB images, and might be a good starting point for
creating your own scale factors. See `Default Ramps`_ for more information.

The colorization filter populates dimensions in the point buffer using input

values to points from an aerial photograph of an area. However, any band can be
read from the raster and applied to any dimension name desired.

    supported `format`_ can be read.

.. _GDAL: http://www.gdal.org

The bands of the raster to apply to each are selected using the "band" option,
and the values of the band may be scaled before being written to the dimension.
If the band range is 0-1, for example, it might make sense to scale by 256 to
fit into a traditional 1-byte color value range.

  ]

Considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain data configurations can cause degenerate filter behavior.
One significant knob to adjust is the ``GDAL_CACHEMAX`` environment
variable. One driver which can have issues is when a `TIFF`_ file is
striped vs. tiled. GDAL's data access in that situation is likely to
cause lots of re-reading if the cache isn't large enough.

Consider a striped TIFF file of 286mb:

::

    -rw-r-----@  1 hobu  staff   286M Oct 29 16:58 orth-striped.tif

.. code-block:: json

  [
      "colourless.laz",
      {
        "type":"filters.colorization",
        "raster":"orth-striped.tif"
      },
      "coloured-striped.las"
  ]

Simple application of the :ref:`filters.colorization` using the striped `TIFF`_
with a 268mb :ref:`readers.las` file will take nearly 1:54.

.. _`TIFF`: http://www.gdal.org/frmt_gtiff.html

::

    [hobu@pyro knudsen (master)]$ time ~/dev/git/pdal/bin/pdal pipeline -i striped.json

    real    1m53.477s
    user    1m20.018s
    sys 0m33.397s


Setting the ``GDAL_CACHEMAX`` variable to a size larger than the TIFF file
dramatically speeds up the color fetching:

::

    [hobu@pyro knudsen (master)]$ export GDAL_CACHEMAX=500
    [hobu@pyro knudsen (master)]$ time ~/dev/git/pdal/bin/pdal pipeline striped.json

    user    0m15.557s
    sys 0m1.102s

Options
-------

raster
  The raster file to read the band from. Any `format`_ supported by
  `GDAL`_ may be read.

dimensions
  A comma separated list of dimensions to populate with values from the raster
  file. Dimensions will be created if they don't already exist.  The format

  separators if the data is not ambiguous.  If not supplied, band numbers
  begin at 1 and increment from the band number of the previous dimension.

filters.covariancefeatures
===============================================================================

This filter implements various local feature descriptors that are based on the
covariance matrix of a point's neighborhood.

The user can pick a set of feature descriptors by setting the ``feature_set``
option. The dimensionality_ set of feature descriptors introduced below is the
default. The user can also provide a comma-separated list of features to
explicitly itemize those covariance features they wish to be computed. This can
be combined with any suppported presets like "Dimensionality".  Specifying "all"
will compute all available features.

Supported features include:

* Anisotropy
* DemantkeVerticality
* Density
* Eigenentropy
* Linearity
* Omnivariance
* Planarity
* Scattering
* EigenvalueSum
* SurfaceVariation
* Verticality

.. note::

    Density requires both ``OptimalKNN`` and ``OptimalRadius`` which can be
    computed by running :ref:`filters.optimalneighborhood` prior to
    ``filters.covariancefeatures``.

Options
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

knn
  The number of k nearest neighbors used for calculating the covariance matrix.
  [Default: 10]

threads
  The number of threads to use. Only valid in :ref:`standard mode <processing_modes>`. [Default: 1]

feature_set
  A comma-separated list of individual features or feature presets (e.g.,
  "Dimensionality") to be computed. To compute all available features, specify
  "all". [Default: "Dimensionality"]

stride
  When finding k nearest neighbors, stride determines the sampling rate. A
  stride of 1 retains each neighbor in order. A stride of two selects every
  other neighbor and so on. [Default: 1]

min_k
  Minimum number of neighbors in radius (radius search only). [Default: 3]

radius
  If radius is specified, neighbors will be obtained by radius search rather
  than k nearest neighbors, subject to meeting the minimum number of neighbors
  (``min_k``).

mode
  By default, features are computed using the standard deviation along each
  eigenvector, i.e., using the square root of the computed eigenvalues
  (``mode="SQRT"``). ``mode`` also accepts "Normalized" which normalizes
  eigenvalue such that they sum to one, or "Raw" such that the eigenvalues are
  used directly. [Default: "SQRT"]

optimized
  ``optimized`` can be set to ``true`` to enable computation of features using
  precomputed optimal neighborhoods (found in the ``OptimalKNN`` dimension).
  Requires :ref:`filters.optimalneighborhood` be run prior to this stage.
  [Default: false]

.. _dimensionality:

Dimensionality feature set
................................................................................

The features introduced in [Demantke2011]_ describe the shape of the
neighborhood, indicating whether the local geometry is more linear (1D), planar
(2D) or volumetric (3D) while the one introduced in [Guinard2017]_ adds the
idea of a structure being vertical.

The dimensionality filter introduces the following four descriptors that are
computed from the covariance matrix of a point's neighbors (as defined by
``knn`` or ``radius``):

* linearity - higher for long thin strips
* planarity - higher for planar surfaces
* scattering - higher for complex 3d neighbourhoods
* verticality - higher for vertical structures, highest for thin vertical strips

It introduces four new dimensions that hold each one of these values:
``Linearity``, ``Planarity``, ``Scattering`` and ``Verticality``.

.. _filters.cpd:

filters.cpd
==============

The **Coherent Point Drift (CPD) filter** uses the algorithm of
:cite:`Myronenko` algorithm to
compute a rigid, nonrigid, or affine transformation between datasets.  The
rigid and affine are what you'd expect; the nonrigid transformation uses Motion
Coherence Theory :cite:`Yuille1998` to "bend" the points to find a best
alignment.

.. note::

    CPD is computationally intensive and can be slow when working with many
    points (i.e. > 10,000).  Nonrigid is significantly slower
    than rigid and affine.

The first input to the change filter are considered the "fixed" points, and all
subsequent inputs are "moving" points.  The output from the change filter are
the "moving" points after the calculated transformation has been applied, one
point view per input.  Any additional information about the cpd registration,
e.g. the rigid transformation matrix, will be placed in the stage's metadata.

When to use CPD vs ICP
----------------------

Summarized from the `Non-rigid point set registration: Coherent Point Drift
<http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs468-07-winter/Papers/nips2006_0613.pdf>`_ paper.

- CPD outperforms the ICP in the presence of noise and outliers by the use of
  a probabilistic assignment of correspondences between pointsets, which is
  innately more robust than the binary assignment used in ICP.

- CPD does not work well for large in-plane rotation, such transformation can
  be first compensated by other well known global registration techniques before
  CPD algorithm is carried out

- CPD is most effective when estimating smooth non-rigid transformations.

============

The **crop filter** removes points that fall outside or inside a
cropping bounding
box (2D or 3D), polygon, or point+distance.  If more than one bounding region is
specified, the filter will pass all input points through each bounding region,
creating an output point set for each input crop region.

.. embed::

.. streamable::

The provided bounding regions are assumed to have the same spatial reference
as the points unless the option a_srs_ provides an explicit spatial reference
for bounding regions.
If the point input consists of multiple point views with differing
spatial references, one is chosen at random and assumed to be the
spatial reference of the input bounding region.  In this case a warning will
be logged.

The Extended Local Minimum (ELM) filter marks low points as noise. This filter
is an implementation of the method described in [Chen2012]_.

ELM begins by rasterizing the input point cloud data at the given cell_ size.
Within each cell, the lowest point is considered noise if the next lowest point
is a given threshold above the current point. If it is marked as noise, the
difference between the next two points is also considered, marking points as
noise if needed, and continuing until another neighbor is found to be within the
threshold. At this point, iteration for the current cell stops, and the next
cell is considered.

.. embed::

Example #1
----------

The following PDAL pipeline applies the ELM filter, using a cell_ size of 20
and
applying the :ref:`classification <class>` code of 18 to those points
determined to be noise.

    }

Example #2
----------

This variation of the pipeline begins by assigning a value of 0 to all
classifications, thus resetting any existing classifications. It then proceeds
to compute ELM with a threshold_ value of 2.0, and finishes by extracting all
returns that are not marked as noise.

filters.estimaterank
===============================================================================

The **rank estimation filter** uses singular value decomposition (SVD) to
estimate the rank of a set of points. Point sets with rank 1 correspond
to linear features, while sets with rank 2 correspond to planar features.
Rank 3 corresponds to a full 3D feature. In practice this can be used alone, or
possibly in conjunction with other filters to extract features (e.g.,
buildings, vegetation).

Two parameters are required to estimate rank (though the default values will be
suitable in many cases). First, the knn_ parameter defines the number of
points to consider when computing the SVD and estimated rank. Second, the
thresh_ parameter is used to determine when a singular value shall be
considered non-zero (when the absolute value of the singular value is greater
than the threshold).

The rank estimation is performed on a pointwise basis, meaning for each point
in the input point cloud, we find its knn_ neighbors, compute the SVD, and
estimate rank. The filter creates a new dimension called ``Rank``
that can be used downstream of this filter stage in the pipeline. The type of
writer used will determine whether or not the ``Rank`` dimension itself can be
saved to disk.

The ferry filter copies data from one dimension to another, creates new

The filter is guided by a list of 'from' and 'to' dimensions in the format
<from>=><to>.  Data from the 'from' dimension is copied to the 'to' dimension.
The 'from' dimension must exist.  The 'to' dimension can be pre-existing or
will be created by the ferry filter.

======================

The **gpstimeconvert** filter converts between three GPS time standards found in
lidar data:

1. GPS time (gt)
2. GPS standard time (gst), also known as GPS adjusted time
3. GPS week seconds (gws)

Since GPS week seconds are ambiguous (they reset to 0 at the start of each new
GPS week), care must be taken when they are the source or destination of a
conversion:

* When converting from GPS week seconds, the GPS week number must be known. This
  is accomplished by specifying the start_date_ (in the GMT time zone) on which
  the data collection started. The filter will resolve the ambiguity using the
  supplied start date.
* When converting from GPS week seconds and the times span a new GPS week, the
  presence or absence of week second wrapping must be specified with the
  wrapped_ option. Wrapped week seconds reset to 0 at the start of a new week;
  unwrapped week seconds are allowed to exceed 604800 (60x60x24x7) seconds.
* When converting to GPS week seconds, the week second wrapping preference
  should be specified with the wrap_ option.

.. note::

  The filter assumes points are ordered by ascending time, which can be
  accomplished by running :ref:`filters.sort` prior to
  ``filters.gpstimeconvert``. Note that GPS week second times that span a new
  GPS week should not be sorted unless they are unwrapped.

   We expect ground returns to have the classification value of 2 in keeping

Ground points may be generated by :ref:`filters.pmf` or :ref:`filters.smrf`,
but you can use any method you choose, as long as the ground returns are
marked.

Normalized heights are a commonly used attribute of point cloud data. This can
also be referred to as *height above ground* (HAG) or *above ground level*
(AGL) heights. In the end, it is simply a measure of a point's relative height
as opposed to its raw elevation value.

The filter creates a delaunay triangulation of the `count`_ ground points
closest to the non-ground point in question.  If the non-ground point is within
the triangulated area, the assigned ``HeightAboveGround`` is the difference
between its ``Z`` value and a ground height interpolated from the three
vertices of the containing triangle.  If the non-ground point is outside of the
triangulated area, its ``HeightAboveGround`` is calculated as the difference
between its ``Z`` value and the ``Z`` value of the nearest ground point.

Choosing a value for `count`_ is difficult, as placing the non-ground point in
the triangulated area depends on the layout of the nearby points.  If, for
example, all the ground points near a non-ground point lay on one side of that
non-ground point, finding a containing triangle will fail.

==============

A common questions for users of point clouds is what the spatial extent of a
point cloud collection is. Files generally provide only rectangular bounds, but
often the points inside the files only fill up a small percentage of the area
within the bounds.

.. figure:: filters.hexbin.img1.jpg

    :alt: Hexbin derived from input point buffer

    Hexbin output shows boundary of actual points in point buffer, not
    just rectangular extents.

The hexbin filter reads a point stream and writes out a metadata record that
contains a boundary, expressed as a well-known text polygon. The filter counts
the points in each hexagonal area to determine if that area should be included
as part of the boundary.  In
order to write out the metadata record, the *pdal* pipeline command must be
invoked using the "--pipeline-serialization" option:

class filters_icp(_GenericStage):
    """
.. _filters.icp:

filters.icp
==============

The **ICP filter** uses the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to
calculate a **rigid** (rotation and translation) transformation that best
aligns two datasets.  The first input to the ICP filter is considered the
"fixed" points, and all subsequent points are "moving" points.  The output from
the filter are the "moving" points after the calculated transformation has been
applied, one point view per input.  The transformation matrix is inserted into
the stage's metadata.

.. note::

    ICP requires the initial pose of the two point sets to be adequately close,
    which is not always possible, especially when the transformation is
    non-rigid.  ICP can handle limited non-rigid transformations but be aware
    ICP may be unable to escape a local minimum. Consider using CPD instead.

    From :cite:`Xuechen2019`:

    ICP starts with an initial guess of the transformation between the two
    point sets and then iterates between finding the correspondence under the
    current transformation and updating the transformation with the newly found
    correspondence. ICP is widely used because it is rather straightforward and
    easy to implement in practice; however, its biggest problem is that it does
    not guarantee finding the globally optimal transformation. In fact, ICP
    converges within a very small basin in the parameter space, and it easily
    becomes trapped in local minima. Therefore, the results of ICP are very
    sensitive to the initialization, especially when high levels of noise and
    large proportions of outliers exist.

To get the ``transform`` matrix, you'll need to use the ``--metadata`` option
from the pipeline command:

::

    $ pdal pipeline icp-pipeline.json --metadata icp-metadata.json

The metadata output might start something like:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "stages":
        {
            "filters.icp":

            }


To apply this transformation to other points, the ``centroid`` and ``transform``
metadata items can by used with ``filters.transformation`` in another pipeline.  First,
move the centroid of the points to (0,0,0), then apply the transform, then move
the points back to the original location.  For the above metadata, the pipeline
would be similar to:

a tree are labeled with a ``ClusterID``. Tree IDs start at 1, with non-tree points
given a ``ClusterID`` of 0.

  The filter differs only slightly from the paper in the addition of a few
  conditions on size of tree, minimum height above ground for tree seeding, and

The **Local Outlier Factor (LOF) filter** was introduced as a method
of determining the degree to which an object is an outlier. This filter
is an implementation of the method
described in [Breunig2000]_.

The filter creates three new dimensions, ``NNDistance``,
``LocalReachabilityDistance`` and ``LocalOutlierFactor``, all of which are
double-precision floating values. The ``NNDistance`` dimension records the
Euclidean distance between a point and it's k-th nearest neighbor (the number
of k neighbors is set with the minpts_ option). The
``LocalReachabilityDistance`` is the inverse of the mean
of all reachability distances for a neighborhood of points. This reachability
distance is defined as the max of the Euclidean distance to a neighboring point
and that neighbor's own previously computed ``NNDistance``. Finally, each point
has a ``LocalOutlierFactor`` which is the mean of all
``LocalReachabilityDistance`` values for the neighborhood. In each case, the
neighborhood is the set of k nearest neighbors.

In practice, setting the minpts_ parameter appropriately and subsequently
filtering outliers based on the computed ``LocalOutlierFactor`` can be
difficult. The authors present some work on establishing upper and lower bounds
on LOF values, and provide some guidelines on selecting minpts_ values, which
users of this filter should find instructive.

  To inspect the newly created, non-standard dimensions, be sure to write to an
  output format that can support arbitrary dimensions, such as BPF.

In most cases, this happens automatically on output and use of the merge

different spatial references.  No checks are made to ensure that points
from various sources being merged have similar dimensions or are generally
compatible.

This pipeline will create an output file "output.las" that contcatenates

Here are a pair of unlikely pipelines that show one way in which a merge filter

carried separately through the pipeline, three files are created as output,
"out1.las", "out2.las" and "out3.las".  "out1.las" contains the points

The **Miniball Criterion** was introduced in [Weyrich2004]_ and is based on the
assumption that points that are distant to the cluster built by their
k-neighborhood are likely to be outliers. First, the smallest enclosing ball is
computed for the k-neighborhood, giving a center point and radius
[Fischer2010]_. The miniball criterion is then computed by comparing the
distance (from the current point to the miniball center) to the radius of the
miniball.

The author suggests that the Miniball Criterion is more robust than the
:ref:`Plane Fit Criterion <filters.planefit>` around high-frequency details,
but demonstrates poor outlier detection for points close to a smooth surface.

The filter creates a single new dimension, ``Miniball``, that records the
Miniball criterion for the current point.

Expression
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A query expression is a combination of comparison and logical operators that
define a query which can be used to select matching points by their attribute
values.

Comparison operators
................................................................................

There are 8 valid query comparison operators:

    - ``$eq``: Matches values equal to a specified value.
    - ``$gt``: Matches values greater than a specified value.
    - ``$gte``: Matches values greater than or equal to a specified value.
    - ``$lt``: Matches values less than a specified value.
    - ``$lte``: Matches values less than or equal to a specified value.
    - ``$ne``: Matches values not equal to a specified value.
    - ``$in``: Matches any of the values specified in the array.
    - ``$nin``: Matches none of the values specified in the array.

Comparison operators compare a point cloud attribute with an operand or an
array of operands.  An *operand* is either a numeric constant or a string
representing a dimension name.  For all comparison operators except for ``$in``
and ``$nin``, the comparison value must be a single operand.  For ``$in`` and
``$nin``, the value must be an array of operands.

Comparison operator specifications must be contained within an object whose key
is the dimension name to be compared.

.. code-block:: json

    { "Classification": { "$eq": 2 } }

.. code-block:: json

    { "Intensity": { "$gt": 0 } }

.. code-block:: json

    { "Classification": { "$in": [2, 6, 9] } }

The ``$eq`` comparison operator may be implicitly invoked by setting an
attribute name directly to a value.

.. code-block:: json

    { "Classification": 2 }

Logical operators
................................................................................

There are 4 valid logical operators:

    - ``$and``: Applies a logical **and** on the expressions of the array and
      returns a match only if all expressions match.
    - ``$not``: Inverts the value of the single sub-expression.
    - ``$nor``: Applies a logical **nor** on the expressions of the array and
      returns a match only if all expressions fail to match.
    - ``$nor``: Applies a logical **or** on the expressions of the array and
      returns a match if any of the expressions match.

Logical operators are used to logically combine sub-expressions.  All logical
operators except for ``$not`` are applied to arrays of expressions.
``$not`` is applied to a single expression and negates its result.

Logical operators may be applied directly to comparison expressions or may
contain further nested logical operators.  For example:

.. code-block:: json

    { "$or": [
        { "Classification": 2 },
        { "Intensity": { "$gt": 0 } }
    ] }

.. code-block:: json

    { "$or": [
        { "Classification": 2 },
        { "$and": [
            { "ReturnNumber": "NumberOfReturns" },
            { "NumberOfReturns": { "$gt": 1 } }
        ] }
    ] }

.. code-block:: json

    { "$not": {
        "$or": [
            { "Classification": 2 },
            { "$and": [
                { "ReturnNumber": { "$gt": 0 } },
                { "Z": { "$lte": 42 } }
            ] }
        ] }
    }

For any individual dimension, the logical **and** may be implicitly invoked
via multiple comparisons within the comparison object.  For example:

.. code-block:: json

    { "X": { "$gt": 0, "$lt": 42 } }

filters.neighborclassifier
==========================

The **neighborclassifier filter** allows you update the value of
the classification
for specific points to a value determined by a K-nearest neighbors vote.
For each point, the k_ nearest neighbors are queried and if more than half of
them have the same value, the filter updates the selected point accordingly

For example, if an automated classification procedure put/left erroneous
vegetation points near the edges of buildings which were largely classified
correctly, you could try using this filter to fix that problem.

Similiarly, some automated classification processes result in prediction for
only a subset of the original point cloud.  This filter could be used to
extrapolate those predictions to the original.

class filters_normal(_GenericStage):
    """
.. _filters.normal:

filters.normal
==============

The **normal filter** returns the estimated normal and curvature for
a collection
of points. The algorithm first computes the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
collection of points, which is comprised of the k-nearest neighbors. The normal
is taken as the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue. The
curvature is computed as

.. math::

  curvature = /frac{/lambda_0}{/lambda_0 + /lambda_1 + /lambda_2}

where :math:`/lambda_i` are the eigenvalues sorted in ascending order.

The filter produces four new dimensions (``NormalX``, ``NormalY``, ``NormalZ``,
and ``Curvature``), which can be analyzed directly, or consumed by downstream
stages for more advanced filtering.

The eigenvalue decomposition is performed using Eigen's
`SelfAdjointEigenSolver <https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1SelfAdjointEigenSolver.html>`_.

Normals will be automatically flipped towards positive Z, unless the always_up_
flag is set to `false`. Users can optionally set any of the XYZ coordinates to
specify a custom viewpoint_ or set them all to zero to effectively disable the
normal flipping.

.. note::

  By default, the Normal filter will invert normals such that they are always
  pointed "up" (positive Z). If the user provides a viewpoint_, normals will
  instead be inverted such that they are oriented towards the viewpoint,
  regardless of the always_up_ flag. To disable all normal flipping, do not
  provide a viewpoint_ and set `always_up`_ to false.

In addition to always_up_ and viewpoint_, users can run a refinement step (off
by default) that propagates normals using a minimum spanning tree. The
propagated normals can lead to much more consistent results across the dataset.

.. note::

  To enable normal propagation, users can set refine_ to `true`.

statistical. These two approaches are discussed in further detail below.

It is worth noting that both filtering methods simply apply a classification

To remove the noise
points altogether, users can add a :ref:`range filter<filters.range>` to their

Statistical Method
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The default method for identifying outlier points is the statistical outlier method. This method requires two passes through the input ``PointView``, first to compute a threshold value based on global statistics, and second to identify outliers using the computed threshold.

In the first pass, for each point :math:`p_i` in the input ``PointView``, compute the mean distance :math:`/mu_i` to each of the :math:`k` nearest neighbors (where :math:`k` is configurable and specified by mean_k_). Then,

.. math::

  /overline{/mu} = /frac{1}{N} /sum_{i=1}^N /mu_i

.. math::

  /sigma = /sqrt{/frac{1}{N-1} /sum_{i=1}^N (/mu_i - /overline{/mu})^2}

A global mean :math:`/overline{/mu}` of these mean distances is then computed along with the standard deviation :math:`/sigma`. From this, the threshold is computed as

.. math::

  t = /mu + m/sigma

where :math:`m` is a user-defined multiplier specified by multiplier_.

We now iterate over the pre-computed mean distances :math:`/mu_i` and compare to computed threshold value. If :math:`/mu_i` is greater than the threshold, it is marked as an outlier.

.. math::

  outlier_i = /begin{cases}
      /text{true,} /phantom{false,} /text{if } /mu_i >= t //
      /text{false,} /phantom{true,} /text{otherwise} //
  /end{cases}

.. figure:: filters.statisticaloutlier.img1.png

    :alt: Points before outlier removal

Before outlier removal, noise points can be found both above and below the
scene.

    :alt: Points after outlier removal

See [Rusu2008]_ for more information.

In this example, points are marked as outliers if the average distance to each
of the 12 nearest neighbors is below the computed threshold.

          "multiplier":2.2
      },
      "output.las"
  ]

Radius Method
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each point :math:`p_i` in the input ``PointView``, this method counts the
number of neighboring points :math:`k_i` within radius :math:`r` (specified by
radius_). If :math:`k_i<k_{min}`, where :math:`k_{min}` is the minimum number
of neighbors specified by min_k_, it is marked as an outlier.

.. math::

  outlier_i = /begin{cases}
      /text{true,} /phantom{false,} /text{if } k_i < k_{min} //
      /text{false,} /phantom{true,} /text{otherwise} //

filters.planefit
===============================================================================

The **Plane Fit Criterion** was introduced in [Weyrich2004]_ and computes the
deviation of a point from a manifold approximating its neighbors.  First, a
plane is fit to each point's k-neighborhood by performing an eigenvalue
decomposition. Next, the mean point to plane distance is computed by
considering all points within the neighborhood. This is compared to the point
to plane distance of the current point giving rise to the k-neighborhood. As
the mean distance of the k-neighborhood approaches 0, the Plane Fit criterion
will tend toward 1. As point to plane distance of the current point approaches
0, the Plane Fit criterion will tend toward 0.

The author suggests that the Plane Fit Criterion is well suited to outlier
detection when considering noisy reconstructions of smooth surfaces, but
produces poor results around small features and creases.

The filter creates a single new dimension, ``PlaneFit``, that records the
Plane Fit criterion for the current point.

.. note::

  To inspect the newly created, non-standard dimensions, be sure to write to an
  output format that can support arbitrary dimensions, such as BPF.

Example
-------

The sample pipeline below computes the Plane Fit criterion with a neighborhood
of 8 neighbors. We do not apply a fixed threshold to single out outliers based
on the Plane Fit criterion as the range of values can vary from one dataset to
another. In general, higher values indicate the likelihood of a point being an
outlier.

Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* slope_ controls the height threshold at each iteration. A slope of 1.0
  represents a 1:1 or 45º.

* initial_distance_ is _intended_ to be set to account for z noise, so for a
  flat surface if you have an uncertainty of around 15 cm, you set
  initial_distance_ large enough to not exclude these points from the ground.

* For a given iteration, the height threshold is determined by multiplying
  slope by cell_size_ by the difference in window size between the
  current and last iteration, plus the initial_distance_. This height
  threshold is constant across all cells and is maxed out at the
  max_distance_ value. If the difference in elevation between a point and its
  “opened” value (from the morphological operator) exceeds the height threshold,
  it is treated as non-ground.  So, bigger slope leads to bigger height
  thresholds, and these grow with each iteration (not to exceed the max).  With
  flat terrain, keep this low, the thresholds are small, and stuff is more
  aggressively dumped into non-ground class.  In rugged terrain, open things up
  a little, but then you can start missing buildings, veg, etc.

* Very large max_window_size_ values will result in a lot of potentially
  extra iteration. This parameter can have a strongly negative impact on
  computation performance.

* exponential_ is used to control the rate of growth of morphological window
  sizes toward max_window_size_. Linear growth preserves gradually changing
  topographic features well, but demands considerable compute time. The default
  behavior is to grow the window sizes exponentially, thus reducing the number
  of iterations.

* This filter will mark all returns deemed to be ground returns with a
  classification value of 2 (per the LAS specification). To extract only these
  returns, users can add a :ref:`range filter<filters.range>` to the pipeline.

The **Poisson Filter** passes data Mischa Kazhdan's poisson surface
reconstruction
algorithm. [Kazhdan2006]_  It creates a watertight surface from the original
point set by creating an entirely new point set representing the imputed
isosurface.  The algorithm requires normal vectors to each point in order
to run.  If the x, y and z normal dimensions are present in the input point
set, they will be used by the algorithm.  If they don't exist, the poisson
filter will invoke the PDAL normal filter to create them before running.

The poisson algorithm will usually create a larger output point set
than the input point set.  Because the algorithm constructs new points, data
associated with the original points set will be lost, as the algorithm has
limited ability to impute associated data.  However, if color dimensions
(red, green and blue) are present in the input, colors will be reconstructed
in the output point set. This filter will also run the
:ref:`normal filter <filters.normal>` on the output point set.

This integration of the algorithm with PDAL only supports a limited set of
the options available to the implementation.  If you need support for further
options, please let us know.

The **Python Filter** allows `Python`_ software to be embedded in a
:ref:`pipeline` that allows modification of PDAL points through a `NumPy`_
array.  Additionally, some global :ref:`metadata` is also
available that Python functions can interact with.

The function must have two `NumPy`_ arrays as arguments, ``ins`` and ``outs``.
The ``ins`` array represents the points before the ``filters.python``
filter and the ``outs`` array represents the points after filtering.

.. warning::

    Make sure `NumPy`_ is installed in your `Python`_ environment.

    .. code-block:: shell

        $ python3 -c "import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)"
        1.18.1

.. warning::

    Each array contains all the :ref:`dimensions` of the incoming ``ins``
    point schema.  Each array in the ``outs`` list matches the `NumPy`_
    array of the same type as provided as ``ins`` for shape and type.

.. plugin::

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np

  def multiply_z(ins,outs):
      Z = ins['Z']
      Z = Z * 10.0
      outs['Z'] = Z
      return True


1) The function must always return `True` upon success. If the function
   returned `False`, an error would be thrown and the :ref:`pipeline` exited.



2) If you want write a dimension that might not be available, you can specify
   it with the add_dimension_ option:

   ::

       "add_dimension": "NewDimensionOne"

   To create more than one dimension, this option also accepts an array:

   ::

       "add_dimension": [ "NewDimensionOne", "NewDimensionTwo", "NewDimensionThree" ]


   You can also specify the :ref:`type <types>` of the dimension using an ``=``.

       "add_dimension": "NewDimensionOne=uint8"

The JSON pipeline file referenced the external `multiply_z.py` `Python`_ script,
which scales the ``Z`` coordinate by a factor of 10.

  def multiply_z(ins,outs):
      Z = ins['Z']
      Z = Z * 10.0
      outs['Z'] = Z
      return True

Predicates
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Points can be retained/removed from the stream by setting true/false values
into a special "Mask" dimension in the output point array.

The example above sets the "mask" to true for points that are in
classifications 1 or 2 and to false otherwise, causing points that are not
classified 1 or 2 to be dropped from the point stream.

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np

  def filter(ins,outs):
     cls = ins['Classification']

     keep_classes = [1, 2]

     # Use the first test for our base array.
     keep = np.equal(cls, keep_classes[0])

     # For 1:n, test each predicate and join back
     # to our existing predicate array
     for k in range(1, len(keep_classes)):
         t = np.equal(cls, keep_classes[k])
         keep = keep + t

     outs['Mask'] = keep
     return True

.. note::

    :ref:`filters.range` is a specialized filter that implements the exact
    functionality described in this Python operation. It is likely to be much
    faster than Python, but not as flexible. :ref:`filters.python` is the tool
    you can use for prototyping point stream processing operations.

.. seealso::

    If you want to read a :ref:`pipeline` of operations into a numpy
    array, the `PDAL Python extension <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PDAL>`_
    is available.

          "filename":"file-filtered.las"
      }
  ]

Module Globals
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three global variables are added to the Python module as it is run to allow
you to get :ref:`dimensions`, :ref:`metadata`, and coordinate system
information.
Additionally, the ``metadata`` object can be set by the function
to modify metadata
for the in-scope :ref:`filters.python` :cpp:class:`pdal::Stage`.

.. code-block:: python

   def myfunc(ins,outs):
       print('schema: ', schema)
       print('srs: ', spatialreference)
       print('metadata: ', metadata)
       outs = ins
       return True

Setting stage metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::
    The name of the output metadata variable has changed from ``metadata`` to ``out_metadata``.

Stage metadata can be created by using the ``out_metadata`` dictionary **global** variable.
The ``name`` key must be set. The type of the ``value`` can usually be inferred, but
can be set to one of ``integer``, ``nonNegativeInteger``, ``double``, ``bounds``,
``boolean``, ``spatialreference``, ``uuid`` or ``string``.

Children may be set using the ``children`` key whose value is a list of dictionaries.

.. code-block:: python

   def myfunc(ins,outs):
     global out_metadata
     out_metadata = {'name': 'root', 'value': 'a string', 'type': 'string', 'description': 'a description', 'children': [{'name': 'somekey', 'value': 52, 'type': 'integer', 'description': 'a filter description', 'children': []}, {'name': 'readers.faux', 'value': 'another string', 'type': 'string', 'description': 'a reader description', 'children': []}]}
     return True

Passing Python objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An JSON-formatted option can be passed to the filter representing a
Python dictionary containing objects you want to use in your function.
This feature is useful in situations where you
wish to call :ref:`pipeline_command` with substitutions.

If we needed to be able to provide the Z scaling factor of `Example Pipeline`_
with a
Python argument, we can place that in a dictionary and pass that to the filter
as a separate argument. This feature allows us to be able easily reuse the same
basic Python function while substituting values as necessary.

.. code-block:: json

  [
      "input.las",
      {
          "type":"filters.python",
          "module":"anything",
          "function":"filter",
          "script":"arguments.py",
          "pdalargs":"{/"factor/":0.3048,/"an_argument/":42, /"another/": /"a string/"}"
      },
      "output.las"
  ]

With that option set, you can now fetch the pdalargs_ dictionary in your
Python script and use it:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np

  def multiply_z(ins,outs):
      Z = ins['Z']
      Z = Z * float(pdalargs['factor'])
      outs['Z'] = Z
      return True


Standard output and error
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``redirector`` module is available for scripts to output to PDAL's log stream
explicitly. The module handles redirecting ``sys.stderr`` and
``sys.stdout`` for you
transparently, but it can be used directly by scripts. See the PDAL source
code for more details.

  from.

  not being used.

module
  The Python module that is holding the function to run. [Required]

limits
  A comma-separated list of :ref:`ranges`.  If more than one range is
  specified for a dimension, the criteria are treated as being logically
  ORed together.  Ranges for different dimensions are treated as being
  logically ANDed.

  Example:

  ::

    Classification[1:2], Red[1:50], Blue[25:75], Red[75:255], Classification[6:7]

  This specification will select points that have the classification of
  1, 2, 6 or 7 and have a blue value or 25-75 and have a red value of
  1-50 or 75-255.  In this case, all values are inclusive.

Ranges
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A range specification is a dimension name, followed by an optional negation
character ('!'), and a starting and ending value separated by a colon,
surrounded by parentheses or square brackets.  Either the starting or ending
values can be omitted.  Parentheses indicate an open endpoint that doesn't
include the adjacent value.  Square brackets indicate a closed endpoint
that includes the adjacent value.

Example 1:
................................................................................

::

  Z[10:]

Selects all points with a Z value greater than or equal to 10.

Example 2:
................................................................................

::

  Classification[2:2]

Selects all points with a classification of 2.

filters.reciprocity
===============================================================================

The **Nearest-Neighbor Reciprocity Criterion** was introduced in [Weyrich2004]_
and is based on a simple assumption, that valid points may be in the
k-neighborhood of an outlier, but the outlier will most likely not be part of
the valid point's k-neighborhood.

The author suggests that the Nearest-Neighbor Reciprocity Criterion is more
robust than both the :ref:`Plane Fit <filters.planefit>` and :ref:`Miniball
<filters.miniball>` Criterion, being equally sensitive around smooth and
detailed regions. The criterion does however produce invalid results near
manifold borders.

The filter creates a single new dimension, ``Reciprocity``, that records the
percentage of points(in the range 0 to 100) that are considered uni-directional
neighbors of the current point.

.. note::

  To inspect the newly created, non-standard dimensions, be sure to write to an
  output format that can support arbitrary dimensions, such as BPF.

.. embed::

Example
-------

The sample pipeline below computes reciprocity with a neighborhood of 8
neighbors, followed by a range filter to crop out points whose ``Reciprocity``
percentage is less than 98% before writing the output.

filters.reprojection
===========================

The **reprojection filter** converts the X, Y and/or Z dimensions to a
new spatial
reference system. The old coordinates are replaced by the new ones.
If you want to preserve the old coordinates for future processing, use a
:ref:`filters.ferry` to create copies of the original dimensions before
reprojecting.

.. note::

    When coordinates are reprojected, it may significantly change the precision
    necessary to represent the values in some output formats.  Make sure
    that you're familiar with any scaling necessary for your output format
    based on the projection you've used.

Example 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This pipeline reprojects terrain points with Z-values between 0 and 100 by first
applying a range filter and then specifying both the input and output spatial
reference as EPSG-codes. The X and Y dimensions are scaled to allow enough
precision in the output coordinates.

Example 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases it is not possible to use a EPSG-code as a spatial reference.
Instead `Proj.4 <http:/proj4.org>`_ parameters can be used to define a spatial
reference.  In this example the vertical component of points in a laz file is
converted from geometric (ellipsoidal) heights to orthometric heights by using
the ``geoidgrids`` parameter from Proj.4.  Here we change the vertical datum
from the GRS80 ellipsoid to DVR90, the vertical datum in Denmark. In the
writing stage of the pipeline the spatial reference of the file is set to
EPSG:7416. The last step is needed since PDAL will otherwise reference the
vertical datum as "Unnamed Vertical Datum" in the spatial reference VLR.

Filters
=======

Filters operate on data as inline operations. They can remove, modify,
reorganize, and add points to the data stream as it goes by. Some filters can
only operate on dimensions they understand (consider :ref:`filters.reprojection`
doing geographic reprojection on XYZ coordinates), while others do not
interrogate the point data at all and simply reorganize or split data.


Create
------

PDAL filters commonly create new dimensions (e.g., ``HeightAboveGround``) or
alter existing ones (e.g., ``Classification``). These filters will not
invalidate an existing KD-tree.

.. note::

  We treat those filters that alter XYZ coordinates separately.

.. note::

  When creating new dimensions, be mindful of the writer you are using and
  whether or not the custom dimension can be written to disk if that is the
  desired behavior.

.. _filters.sample:

filters.sample
===============================================================================

The **Sample Filter** performs Poisson sampling of the input ``PointView``. The
practice of performing Poisson sampling via "Dart Throwing" was introduced
in the mid-1980's by [Cook1986]_ and [Dippe1985]_, and has been applied to
point clouds in other software [Mesh2009]_.

Our implementation of Poisson sampling is made streamable by voxelizing the
space and only adding points to the output ``PointView`` if they do not violate
the minimum distance criterion (as specified by ``radius``). The voxelization
allows several optimizations, first by checking for existing points within the
same voxel as the point under consideration, which are mostly likely to
violate the minimum distance criterion. Furthermore, we can easily visit
neighboring voxels (limiting the search to those that are populated) without
the need to create a KD-tree from the entire input ``PointView`` first and
performing costly spatial searches.

.. seealso::

    :ref:`filters.decimation`, :ref:`filters.fps`,
    :ref:`filters.relaxationdartthrowing`,
    :ref:`filters.voxelcenternearestneighbor`,
    :ref:`filters.voxelcentroidnearestneighbor`, and :ref:`filters.voxeldownsize` also
    perform decimation.

.. note::

    Starting with PDAL v2.3, the ``filters.sample`` now supports streaming
    mode. As a result, there is no longer an option to ``shuffle`` points (or
    to provide a ``seed`` for the shuffle).

.. note::

    Starting with PDAL v2.3, a ``cell`` option has been added that works with
    the existing ``radius``. The user must provide one or the other, but not
    both. The provided option will be used to automatically compute the other.
    The relationship between ``cell`` and ``radius`` is such that the
    ``radius`` defines the radius of a sphere that circumscribes a voxel with
    edge length defined by ``cell``.

.. note::

    Care must be taken with selection of the ``cell``/``radius`` option.
    Although the filter can now operate in streaming mode, if the extents of
    the point cloud are large (or conversely, if the cell size is small) the
    voxel occupancy map which grows as a function of these variables can still
    require a large memory footprint.

.. note::

    To operate in streaming mode, the filter will typically retain the first
    point to occupy a voxel (subject to the minimum distance criterion set
    forth earlier). This means that point ordering matters, and in fact, it is
    quite possible that points in the incoming stream can be ordered in such a
    way as to introduce undesirable artifacts (e.g., related to previous tiling
    of the data). In our experience, processing data that is still in scan
    order (ordered by GpsTime, if available) does produce reliable results,
    although to require this sort either internally or by inserting
    :ref:`filters.sort` prior to sampling would break our ability to stream the
    data.

disk sampling available in :ref:`filters.sample` and marks all other points as
low noise. It is expected that the input point cloud will either only include

quickly obtained in JSON format by using the command "pdal info --stats".

.. note::

    The filter can compute both sample and population statistics.  For kurtosis,
    the filter can also compute standard and excess kurtosis.  However, only
    a single value is reported for each statistic type in metadata, and that is
    the sample statistic, rather than the population statistic.  For kurtosis
    the sample excess kurtosis is reported.  This seems to match the behavior
    of many other software packages.

transformation that best aligns two datasets. The first input to the ICP filter
is considered the "fixed" points, and all subsequent points are "moving"

To get the ``transform`` matrix, you'll need to use the ``--metadata`` option
from the pipeline command:

::

    $ pdal pipeline teaser-pipeline.json --metadata teaser-metadata.json

The metadata output might start something like:

.. code-block:: json

        "stages":
        {
            "filters.teaser":

            }


To apply this transformation to other points, the ``centroid`` and
``transform`` metadata items can by used with ``filters.transformation`` in
another pipeline. First, move the centroid of the points to (0,0,0), then apply
the transform, then move the points back to the original location.  For the
above metadata, the pipeline would be similar to:

Further details
---------------

A full tutorial about transformation matrices is beyond the scope of this
documentation. Instead, we will provide a few pointers to introduce core
concepts, especially as pertains to PDAL's handling of the ``matrix`` argument.

Transformations in a 3-dimensional coordinate system can be represented
as a homography transformation using homogeneous coordinates. This 4x4
matrix can represent affine transformations describing operations like
translation, rotation, and scaling of coordinates.  In addition it can
represent perspective transformations modeling a pinhole camera.

The transformation filter's ``matrix`` argument is a space delimited, 16
element string. This string is simply a row-major representation of the 4x4
matrix (i.e., first four elements correspond to the top row of the
transformation matrix and so on).

In the event that readers are accustomed to an alternate representation of the
transformation matrix, we provide some simple examples in the form of pure
translations, rotations, and scaling, and show the corresponding ``matrix``
string.

Translation
...........

A pure translation by :math:`t_x`, :math:`t_y`, and :math:`t_z` in the X, Y,
and Z dimensions is represented by the following matrix.

.. math::

    /begin{matrix}
        1 & 0 & 0 & t_x //
        0 & 1 & 0 & t_y //
        0 & 0 & 1 & t_z //
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1
    /end{matrix}

The JSON syntax required for such a translation is written as follows for :math:`t_x=7`, :math:`t_y=8`, and :math:`t_z=9`.

.. code-block:: json

  [
      {
          "type":"filters.transformation",
          "matrix":"1  0  0  7  0  1  0  8  0  0  1  9  0  0  0  1"
      }
  ]

Scaling
.......

Scaling of coordinates is also possible using a transformation matrix. The
matrix shown below will scale the X coordinates by :math:`s_x`, the Y
coordinates by :math:`s_y`, and Z by :math:`s_z`.

.. math::

    /begin{matrix}
        s_x &   0 &   0 & 0 //
          0 & s_y &   0 & 0 //
          0 &   0 & s_z & 0 //
          0 &   0 &   0 & 1
    /end{matrix}

We again provide an example JSON snippet to demonstrate the scaling
transformation. In the example, X and Y are not scaled at all (i.e.,
:math:`s_x=s_y=1`) and Z is magnified by a factor of 2 (:math:`s_z=2`).

.. code-block:: json

  [
      {
          "type":"filters.transformation",
          "matrix":"1  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  2  0  0  0  0  1"
      }
  ]

Rotation
........

A rotation of coordinates by :math:`/theta` radians counter-clockwise about
the z-axis is accomplished with the following matrix.

.. math::

    /begin{matrix}
        /cos{/theta} & -/sin{/theta} & 0 & 0 //
        /sin{/theta} &  /cos{/theta} & 0 & 0 //
                   0 &             0 & 1 & 0 //
                   0 &             0 & 0 & 1
    /end{matrix}

In JSON, a rotation of 90 degrees (:math:`/theta=1.57` radians) takes the form
shown below.

.. code-block:: json

  [
      {
          "type":"filters.transformation",
          "matrix":"0  -1  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  1"
      }
  ]

Similarly, a rotation about the x-axis by :math:`/theta` radians is represented
as

.. math::

    /begin{matrix}
        1 &            0 &             0 & 0 //
        0 & /cos{/theta} & -/sin{/theta} & 0 //
        0 & /sin{/theta} &  /cos{/theta} & 0 //
        0 &            0 &             0 & 1
    /end{matrix}

which takes the following form in JSON for a rotation of 45 degrees (:math:`/theta=0.785` radians)

.. code-block:: json

  [
      {
          "type":"filters.transformation",
          "matrix":"1  0  0  0  0  0.707  -0.707  0  0  0.707  0.707  0  0  0  0  1"
      }
  ]

Finally, a rotation by :math:`/theta` radians about the y-axis is accomplished
with the matrix

.. math::

    /begin{matrix}
         /cos{/theta} & 0 & /sin{/theta} & 0 //
                    0 & 1 &            0 & 0 //
        -/sin{/theta} & 0 & /cos{/theta} & 0 //
                    0 & 0 &            0 & 1
    /end{matrix}

and the JSON string for a rotation of 10 degrees (:math:`/theta=0.175` radians) becomes

.. code-block:: json

  [
      {
          "type":"filters.transformation",
          "matrix":"0.985  0  0.174  0  0  1  0  0  -0.174  0  0.985  0  0  0  0  1"

The input point cloud is divided into 3D voxels at the given cell size. For
each populated voxel, we apply the following ruleset. For voxels with only one
point, the point is passed through to the output. For voxels with exactly two
points, the point closest the voxel center is returned. Finally, for voxels
with more than two points, the centroid of the points within that voxel is
computed. This centroid is used as the query point in a 3D nearest neighbor

The **voxeldownsize filter** is a voxel-based sampling filter.
The input point cloud is divided into 3D voxels at the given cell size.
For each populated voxel, either first point entering in the voxel or
center of a voxel (depending on mode argument) is accepted and voxel is
marked as populated.  All other points entering in the same voxel are
filtered out.

============

The **COPC Reader** supports reading from `COPC format`_ files. A COPC file is
a `LASzip`_ (compressed LAS) file that organizes its data spatially, allowing for
incremental loading and spatial filtering.

.. _LASzip: http://laszip.org
.. _COPC format: https://copc.io/

.. note::

  LAS stores X, Y and Z dimensions as scaled integers.  Users converting an
  input LAS file to an output LAS file will frequently want to use the same
  scale factors and offsets in the output file as existed in the input
  file in order to
  maintain the precision of the data.  Use the `forward` option of
  :ref:`writers.las` to facilitate transfer of header information from
  source COPC files to destination LAS/LAZ files.

.. note::

  COPC files can contain datatypes that are actually arrays rather than
  individual dimensions.  Since PDAL doesn't support these datatypes, it
  must map them into datatypes it supports.  This is done by appending the
  array index to the name of the datatype.  For example, datatypes 11 - 20
  are two dimensional array types and if a field had the name Foo for
  datatype 11, PDAL would create the dimensions Foo0 and Foo1 to hold the
  values associated with LAS field Foo.  Similarly, datatypes 21 - 30 are
  three dimensional arrays and a field of type 21 with the name Bar would
  cause PDAL to create dimensions Bar0, Bar1 and Bar2.  See the information
  on the extra bytes VLR in the `LAS Specification`_ for more information
  on the extra bytes VLR and array datatypes.

.. _LAS Specification: http://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LAS_1_4_r15.pdf

.. note::

    The ``forward`` option of :ref:`writers.copc` or :ref:`writers.las` cannot work
    with EPT due to how EPT can mix content and files. There is no single unified metadata
    value to forward. You will have to explicitly set any output options that you
    would expect to come from EPT on any writers.

Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

filename
    Path to the EPT resource from which to read, ending with ``ept.json``.
    For example, ``/Users/connor/entwine/autzen/ept.json`` or
    ``http://na.entwine.io/autzen/ept.json``. [Required]

spatialreference
    Spatial reference to apply to the data.  Overrides any SRS in the input
    itself.  Can be specified as a WKT, proj.4 or EPSG string. [Default: none]

bounds
    The extents of the resource to select in 2 or 3 dimensions, expressed as a string,
    e.g.: ``([xmin, xmax], [ymin, ymax], [zmin, zmax])``.  If omitted, the entire dataset
    will be selected. The bounds can be followed by a slash ('/') and a spatial reference
    specification to apply to the bounds.

resolution
    A point resolution limit to select, expressed as a grid cell edge length.  Units
    correspond to resource coordinate system units.  For example, for a coordinate system
    expressed in meters, a ``resolution`` value of ``0.1`` will select points up to a
    ground resolution of 100 points per square meter.

    The resulting resolution may not be exactly this value: the minimum possible resolution
    that is at *least* as precise as the requested resolution will be selected.  Therefore
    the result may be a bit more precise than requested.

addons
    A mapping of assignments of the form ``DimensionName: AddonPath``, which
    assigns dimensions from the specified paths to the named dimensions.
    These addon dimensions are created by the
    :ref:`EPT addon writer <writers.ept_addon>`.  If the dimension names
    already exist in the EPT `Schema`_ for the given resource, then their
    values will be overwritten with those from the appropriate addon.

    Addons may used to override well-known :ref:`dimension <dimensions>`.  For example,
    an addon assignment of ``"Classification": "~/addons/autzen/MyGroundDimension/"``
    will override an existing EPT ``Classification`` dimension with the custom dimension.

origin
    EPT datasets are lossless aggregations of potentially multiple source
    files.  The *origin* option can be used to select all points from a
    single source file.  This option may be specified as a string or an
    integral ID.

    The string form of this option selects a source file by its original
    file path.  This may be a substring instead of the entire path, but
    the string must uniquely select only one source file (via substring
    search).  For example, for an EPT dataset created from source files
    *one.las*, *two.las*, and *two.bpf*, "one" is a sufficient selector,
    but "two" is not.

    The integral form of this option selects a source file by its ``OriginId``
    dimension, which can be determined from  the file's position in EPT
    metadata file ``entwine-files.json``.

.. note::

    When using ``pdal info --summary``, using the ``origin`` option will cause the
    resulting bounds to be clipped to those of the selected origin, and the resulting
    number of points to be an upper bound for this selection.

polygon
  The clipping polygon, expressed in a well-known text string,
  e.g.: ``POLYGON((0 0, 5000 10000, 10000 0, 0 0))``.  This option can be
  specified more than once by placing values in an array, in which case all of
  them will be unioned together, acting as a single multipolygon. The polygon definition
  can be followed by a slash ('/') and a spatial reference specification to apply to
  the polygon.

.. note::

    When using ``pdal info --summary``, using the ``polygon`` option will cause the
    resulting bounds to be clipped to the maximal extents of all provided polygons,
    and the resulting number of points to be an upper bound for this polygon selection.

.. note::

    When both the ``bounds`` and ``polygon`` options are specified, only
    the points that fall within *both* the bounds and the polygon(s) will be
    returned.

ogr
  A JSON object representing an OGR query to fetch polygons to use for filtering. The polygons
  fetched from the query are treated exactly like those specified in the ``polygon`` option.
  The JSON object is specified as follows:

  .. code-block:: json

============

The faux reader is used for testing pipelines. It does not read from a
file or database, but generates synthetic data to feed into the pipeline.

The faux reader requires a mode argument to define the method in which points
should be generated.  Valid modes are as follows:

constant
    The values provided as the minimums to the bounds argument are
    used for the X, Y and Z value, respectively, for every point.
random
    Random values are chosen within the provided bounds.
ramp
    Value increase uniformly from the minimum values to the maximum values.
uniform
    Random values of each dimension are uniformly distributed in the
    provided ranges.
normal
    Random values of each dimension are normally distributed in the
    provided ranges.
grid
    Creates points with integer-valued coordinates in the range provided
    (excluding the upper bound).

.. _readers.las:

===========

The **LAS Reader** supports reading from `LAS format`_ files, the standard
interchange format for LIDAR data.  The reader does NOT support point formats
containing waveform data (4, 5, 9 and 10).

The reader also supports compressed LAS files, known as LAZ files or
`LASzip`_ files.
In order to use compressed LAS (LAZ), your version of PDAL must be built
with one of the two supported decompressors, `LASzip`_ or `LAZperf`_.
See the :ref:`compression <las_compression>` option below for more information.

.. _LASzip: http://laszip.org
.. _LAZperf: https://github.com/verma/laz-perf

.. note::

  LAS stores X, Y and Z dimensions as scaled integers.  Users converting an
  input LAS file to an output LAS file will frequently want to use the same
  scale factors and offsets in the output file as existed in the input
  file in order to
  maintain the precision of the data.  Use the `forward` option on the
  :ref:`writers.las` to facilitate transfer of header information from
  source to destination LAS/LAZ files.

.. note::

  LAS 1.4 files can contain datatypes that are actually arrays rather than
  individual dimensions.  Since PDAL doesn't support these datatypes, it
  must map them into datatypes it supports.  This is done by appending the
  array index to the name of the datatype.  For example, datatypes 11 - 20
  are two dimensional array types and if a field had the name Foo for
  datatype 11, PDAL would create the dimensions Foo0 and Foo1 to hold the
  values associated with LAS field Foo.  Similarly, datatypes 21 - 30 are
  three dimensional arrays and a field of type 21 with the name Bar would
  cause PDAL to create dimensions Bar0, Bar1 and Bar2.  See the information
  on the extra bytes VLR in the `LAS Specification`_ for more information
  on the extra bytes VLR and array datatypes.

.. warning::

  LAS 1.4 files that use the extra bytes VLR and datatype 0 will be accepted,
  but the data associated with a dimension of datatype 0 will be ignored
  (no PDAL dimension will be created).

library to read the data and therefore supports `all formats`_ supported by
that library.  Some common sonar systems are NOT supported by MB-System,
notably Kongsberg, Reson and Norbit.  The mbio reader reads each "beam"

the values for the dimensions 'X', 'Y', 'Z' and 'Amplitude'.  X and Y use
longitude and latitude for units and the Z values are in meters (negative,

.. _readers.memoryview:

readers.memoryview
==================

The memoryview reader is a special stage that allows
the reading of point data arranged in rows directly from memory --
each point needs to have dimension data arranged at a fixed offset
from a base address of the point.
Before each point is read, the memoryview reader calls a function that
should return the point's base address, or a null pointer if there are no
points to be read.

Note that the memoryview reader does not currently work with columnar
data (data where individual dimensions are packed into arrays).

Usage
-----

The memoryview reader cannot be used from the command-line.  It is for use
by software using the PDAL API.

After creating an instance of the memoryview reader, the user should
call pushField() for every dimension that should be read from memory.
pushField() takes a single argument, a MemoryViewReader::Field, that consists
of a dimension name, a type and an offset from the point base address:

.. code-block:: c++

    struct Field
    {
        std::string m_name;
        Dimension::Type m_type;
        size_t m_offset;
    };

    void pushField(const Field&);

The user should also call setIncrementer(), a function that takes a
single argument, a std::function that receives the ID of the point to
be added and should return the base address of the point data, or a
null pointer if there are no more points to be read.

.. code-block:: c++

    using PointIncrementer = std::function<char *(PointId)>;

    void setIncrementer(PointIncrementer inc);

.. _readers.numpy:

readers.numpy
=============

PDAL has support for processing data using :ref:`filters.python`, but it is also
convenient to read data from `Numpy`_ for processing in PDAL.

`Numpy`_ supports saving files with the ``save`` method, usually with the
extension ``.npy``. As of PDAL 1.7.0, ``.npz`` files were not yet supported.

.. warning::

    It is untested whether problems may occur if the versions of Python used
    in writing the file and for reading the file don't match.

Array Types
-----------

readers.numpy supports reading data in two forms:

* As a `structured array`_ with specified field names (from `laspy`_ for
  example)
* As a standard array that contains data of a single type.



Structured Arrays
.................

Numpy arrays can be created as structured data, where each entry is a set
of fields.  Each field has a name.  As an example, `laspy`_ provides its
``.points`` as an array of named fields:

::

    import laspy
    f = laspy.file.File('test/data/autzen/autzen.las')
    print (f.points[0:1])

::

    array([ ((63608330, 84939865, 40735, 65, 73, 1, -11, 126, 7326,  245385.60820904),)],
    dtype=[('point', [('X', '<i4'), ('Y', '<i4'), ('Z', '<i4'), ('intensity', '<u2'), ('flag_byte', 'u1'), ('raw_classification', 'u1'), ('scan_angle_rank', 'i1'), ('user_data', 'u1'), ('pt_src_id', '<u2'), ('gps_time', '<f8')])])

The numpy reader supports reading these Numpy arrays and mapping
field names to standard PDAL :ref:`dimension <dimensions>` names.
If that fails, the reader retries by removing ``_``, ``-``, or ``space``
in turn.  If that also fails, the array field names are used to create
custom PDAL dimensions.


Standard (non-structured) Arrays
................................

Arrays without field information contain a single datatype.  This datatype is
mapped to a dimension specified by the ``dimension`` option.

::

    f = open('./perlin.npy', 'rb')
    data = np.load(f,)

    data.shape
    (100, 100)

    data.dtype
    dtype('float64')

          }
        ]
      }
    }


X, Y and Z Mapping
................................................................................
Unless the X, Y or Z dimension is specified as a field in a structured array,
the reader will create dimensions X, Y and Z as necessary and populate them
based on the position of each item of the array.  Although Numpy arrays always
contain contiguous, linear data, that data can be seen to be arranged in more
than one dimension.  A two-dimensional array will cause dimensions X and Y
to be populated.  A three dimensional array will cause X, Y and Z to be
populated.  An array of more than three dimensions will reuse the X, Y and Z
indices for each dimension over three.

When reading data, X Y and Z can be assigned using row-major (C) order or
column-major (Fortran) order by using the ``order`` option.

Loading Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:ref:`readers.numpy` supports two modes of operation - the first is to pass a
reference to a ``.npy`` file to the ``filename`` argument. It will simply load
it and read.

The second is to provide a reference to a ``.py`` script to the ``filename`` argument.
It will then invoke the Python function specified in ``module`` and ``function`` with
the ``fargs`` that you provide.


Loading from a Python script
................................................................................

A reference to a Python function that returns a Numpy array can also be used
to tell :ref:`readers.numpy` what to load. The following example itself loads
a Numpy array from a Python script

Python Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np

    def load(filename):
        array = np.load(filename)
        return array

Command Line Invocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the above Python file with its ``load`` function, the following
:ref:`pdal info<info_command>` invocation passes in the reference to the filename to load.

::

    pdal info threedim.py  /
        --readers.numpy.function=load /
        --readers.numpy.fargs=threedim.npy /
        --driver readers.numpy

Pipeline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example :ref:`pipeline` definition would follow:

.. code-block::

    [
        {
            "function": "load",
            "filename": "threedim.py",
            "fargs": "threedim.npy",
            "type": "readers.numpy"

.. plugin::

.. streamable::

Installation
------------

To build PDAL with rdb support, ``set rdb_DIR`` to the path of your local
rdblib installation. rdblib can be obtained from the `RIEGL download pages`_
with a properly enabled user account. The rdblib files do not need to be
in a system-level directory, though they could be (e.g. they could be in
``/usr/local``, or just in your home directory somewhere). For help building
PDAL with optional libraries, see `the optional library documentation`_.

.. note::
   - Minimum rdblib version required to build the driver and run
     the tests: 2.1.6
   - This driver was developed and tested on Ubuntu 17.10 using GCC 7.2.0.


Example
-------

This example pipeline reads points from a RDB file and stores them in LAS
format. Only points classified as "ground points" are read since option
``filter`` is set to "riegl.class == 2" (see line 5).

All other point attributes that may exist in the RDB file are ignored unless
the option ``extras`` is set to `true`. If so, a custom dimension is defined
for each additional point attribute, whereas the dimension name is equal to
the point attribute name.

.. note::

   Point attributes are read "as-is", no scaling or unit conversion is done
   by the reader. The only exceptions are point coordinates (``riegl.xyz``)
   and surface normals (``riegl.surface_normal``) which are transformed to
   the RDB file's SRS by applying the matrix defined in the (optional) RDB
   file metadata object ``riegl.geo_tag``.

The reader adds following objects to the stage's metadata node:


Object "database"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    }

The ``riegl.geo_tag`` object defines the Spatial Reference System (SRS) of the
file. The point coordinates are actually stored in a local coordinate system
(usually horizontally leveled) which is based on the SRS. The transformation
from the local system to the SRS is defined by the 4x4 matrix ``pose`` which
is stored in row-wise order. Point coordinates (``riegl.xyz``) and surface
normals (``riegl.surface_normal``) are automatically transformed to the SRS
by the reader.

Details about the metadata objects see RDB SDK documentation.


List "transactions"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of transaction objects describing the history of the file.

Readers
=======

Readers provide :ref:`dimensions` to :ref:`pipeline`. PDAL attempts to
normalize common dimension types, like X, Y, Z, or Intensity, which are often
found in LiDAR point clouds. Not all dimension types need to be fixed, however.
Database drivers typically return unstructured lists of dimensions.  A reader
might provide a simple file type, like :ref:`readers.text`, a complex database
like :ref:`readers.pgpointcloud`, or a network service like :ref:`readers.ept`.

   This software has not been developed by RIEGL, and RIEGL will not provide
   any support for this driver.  Please do not contact RIEGL with any
   questions or issues regarding this driver.  RIEGL is not responsible

   This driver has been tested against RiVLib version 1.39 on a Ubuntu
   14.04 using gcc43.

.. plugin::

.. streamable::

Installation
------------

To build PDAL with rxp support, set RiVLib_DIR to the path of your local
RiVLib installation.  RiVLib can be obtained from the `RIEGL download pages`_
with a properly enabled user account.  The RiVLib files do not need to be
in a system-level directory, though they could be (e.g. they could be
in ``/usr/local``, or just in your home directory somewhere).


Example
-------

This example rescales the points, given in the scanner's own coordinate
system, to values that can be written to a las file.  Only points with a
valid gps time, as determined by a pps pulse, are read from the rxp, since
the ``sync_to_pps`` option is "true".  Reflectance values are mapped to
intensity values using sensible defaults.

.. code-block:: json

  [
      {
          "type": "readers.rxp",
          "filename": "120304_204030.rxp",
          "sync_to_pps": "true",

          "filename": "outputfile.las",
          "discard_high_return_numbers": "true"
      }
  ]


We set the ``discard_high_return_numbers`` option to ``true`` on the
:ref:`writers.las`.  RXP files can contain more returns per shot than is
supported by las, and so we need to explicitly tell the las writer to ignore
those high return number points.  You could also use :ref:`filters.python`
to filter those points earlier in the pipeline.


Options
-------

filename
  File to read from, or rdtp URI for network-accessible scanner. [Required]

.. include:: reader_opts.rst

rdtp
  Boolean to switch from file-based reading to RDTP-based. [Default: false]

sync_to_pps
  If "true", ensure all incoming points have a valid pps timestamp, usually
  provided by some sort of GPS clock.  If "false", use the scanner's internal
  time.  [Default: true]

reflectance_as_intensity
  If "true", in addition to storing reflectance values directly, also
  stores the values as Intensity by mapping the reflectance values in the
  range from `min_reflectance` to `max_reflectance` to the range 0-65535.
  Values less than `min_reflectance` are assigned the value 0.
  Values greater `max_reflectance` are assigned the value 65535.
  [Default: true]

min_reflectance
  The low end of the reflectance-to-intensity map.  [Default: -25.0]

max_reflectance
  The high end of the reflectance-to-intensity map.  [Default: 5.0]

min_density and max_density
    This is the range of density of the points in the nodes that will

    the vertex count divided by the effective area of the node. Nodes do
    not have a uniform density across depths in the tree, so some sections
    may be more or less dense than others. Default values for these

Curl Timeouts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STAC reader, and PDAL as a whole, rely on curl for external requests. The curl
requests default to a timeout of 5s. If your requests are failing, it could be
because the timeout is too short. You can set `CURL_TIMEOUT` in your environment
to get around this.

To debug your requests to make sure that the timeout is the problem, set `VERBOSE=1`
in your environment before running your PDAL task.

The **Terrasolid Reader** loads points from `Terrasolid`_ files (.bin).
It supports both Terrasolid format 1 and format 2.

============

The **text reader** reads data from ASCII text files.  Each point is
represented in the file as a single line.  Each line is expected to be divided
into a number of fields by a separator.  Each field represents a value for
a point's dimension.  Each value needs to be `formatted`_ properly for
C++ language double-precision values.

The text reader expects a header line to indicate the dimensions are
in each subsequent line.  There are two types of header lines.

Quoted dimension names
----------------------
When the first character of the header is a double quote, each dimension name
is assumed to be surrounded by double quotes.  A single separator character
is expected between the dimension names (spaces are stripped).  If no separator
character is found, a space is assumed.  You can set the `separator`_ character
if it differs from that in the header.  Note that PDAL requires dimension
names that consist only of alphabetic characters and underscores.  Edit
the header line or use the `header`_ option to set the dimension names to
ones that PDAL understands.

Unquoted dimension names
------------------------

The first non alpha-numeric character encountered is treated as a separator
between dimension names.  The separator in the header line can be overridden
by the `separator`_ option.

Each line in the
file must contain the same number of fields as indicated by
dimension names in the header.  Spaces are generally ignored in the input
unless used as a separator.  When a space character is used as a separator,
any number of consecutive spaces are treated as single space and
leading/trailing spaces are ignored.

Blank lines are ignored after the header line is read.

================================================================================


A `GDAL tile index`_ is an `OGR`_-readable data source of boundary information.
PDAL provides a similar concept for PDAL-readable point cloud data. You can use
the :ref:`tindex_command` application to generate tile index files in any
format that `OGR`_ supports writing. Once you have the tile index, you can then
use the tindex reader to automatically merge and query the data described by
the tiles.

Stages
=======

The stages of a PDAL :ref:`pipeline` are divided into :ref:`readers`, :ref:`filters`
and :ref:`writers`. Stages may support :ref:`streaming mode <processing_modes>` or
not, depending on
their functionality or particular implementation.  Many stages are built into the
base PDAL library (the file pdalcpp.so on Unix, pdalcpp.dylib on OSX and pdalcpp.dll
on Windows).  PDAL can also load stages that have been built separately. These stages
are called plugins.

Stages are usually created as plugins for one of several reasons. First, a user may wish
to create a stage for their own purposes. In this case a user has no need to build
their stage into the PDAL library itself. Second, a stage may depend on some third-party
library that cannot be distributed with PDAL.  Providing the stage as a plugin eliminates
the direct dependency on a library and can simplify licensing issues.  Third, a stage may
be little used and its addition would unnecessarily increase the size of the PDAL library.

PDAL will automatically load plugins when necessary. PDAL plugins have a specific naming
pattern:

::

  libpdal_plugin_<plugin type>_<plugin name>.<shared library extension>

Where <plugin type> is "reader", "writer" or "filter" and <shared library extension> is
".dll" on Windows, ".dylib" on OSX and ".so" on UNIX systems.

The <plugin name> must start with a letter or number, which can be followed by letters,
numbers, or an underscore ('_').

PDAL looks for plugins in the directory that contains the PDAL library itself, as well
as the directories ``.``, ``./lib``, ``../lib``, ``./bin``, ``../bin``. Those paths
are relative to the current working directory.  These locations can be overridden by
setting the environment variable ``PDAL_DRIVER_PATH`` to a list of directories delimited
by ``;`` on Windows and ``:`` on other platforms.

You can use ``pdal --drivers`` to show stages that PDAL is able to load.  Verify the above
if you are having trouble loading specific plugins.

      }

Options
-------

filename
    BPF file to write.  The writer will accept a filename containing
    a single placeholder character ('#').  If input to the writer consists
    of multiple PointViews, each will be written to a separate file, where
    the placeholder will be replaced with an incrementing integer.  If no
    placeholder is found, all PointViews provided to the writer are
    aggregated into a single file for output.  Multiple PointViews are usually
    the result of using :ref:`filters.splitter`, :ref:`filters.chipper` or
    :ref:`filters.divider`.
    [Required]

compression
    This option can be set to true to cause the file to be written with Zlib
    compression as described in the BPF specification.  [Default: false]

format
    Specifies the format for storing points in the file. [Default: dim]

    * dim: Dimension-major (non-interleaved).  All data for a single dimension
      are stored contiguously.
    * point: Point-major (interleaved).  All data for a single point
      are stored contiguously.
    * byte: Byte-major (byte-segregated).  All data for a single dimension are
      stored contiguously, but bytes are arranged such that the first bytes for
      all points are stored contiguously, followed by the second bytes of all
      points, etc.  See the BPF specification for further information.

bundledfile
    Path of file to be written as a bundled file (see specification).  The path
    part of the filespec is removed and the filename is stored as part of the
    data.  This option can be specified as many times as desired.

header_data
    Base64-encoded data that will be decoded and written following the
    standard BPF header.

coord_id
    The coordinate ID (UTM zone) of the data.  Southern zones take negative
    values.  A value of 0 indicates cartesian instead of UTM coordinates.  A
    value of 'auto' will attempt to set the UTM zone from a suitable spatial
    reference, or set to 0 if no such SRS is set.  [Default: 0]

scale_x, scale_y, scale_z
    Scale to be divided from the X, Y and Z nominal values, respectively, after
    the offset has been applied.  The special value "auto" can be specified,
    which causes the writer to select a scale to set the stored values of the
    dimensions to range from [0, 2147483647].  [Default: .01]

    Note: written value = (nominal value - offset) / scale.

offset_x, offset_y, offset_z
    Offset to be subtracted from the X, Y and Z nominal values, respectively,
    before the value is scaled.  The special value "auto" can be specified,
    which causes the writer to set the offset to the minimum value of the
    dimension.  [Default: auto]

    Note: written value = (nominal value - offset) / scale.

    .. note::

        Because BPF data is always stored in UTM, the XYZ offsets are set to
        "auto" by default. This is to avoid truncation of the decimal digits
        (which may occur with offsets left at 0).

output_dims
    If specified, limits the dimensions written for each point.  Dimensions
    are listed by name and separated by commas.  X, Y and Z are required and
    must be explicitly listed.

Options
-------

filename
  Output filename.  [Required]

_`forward`
  List of header fields whose values should be preserved from a source
  LAS file.  The option can be specified multiple times, which has the same effect as
  listing values separated by a comma.  The following values are valid:
  ``filesource_id``, ``global_encoding``, ``project_id``, ``system_id``, ``software_id``,
  ``creation_doy``, ``creation_year``, ``scale_x``, ``scale_y``, ``scale_z``,
  ``offset_x``, ``offset_y``, ``offset_z``.  In addition, the special value ``header``
  can be specified, which is equivalent to specifying all the values EXCEPT the scale and
  offset values.  Scale and offset values can be forwarded as a group by
  using the special values ``scale`` and ``offset`` respectively.  The special
  value ``all`` is equivalent to specifying ``header``, ``scale``, ``offset`` and
  ``vlr`` (see below).  If a header option is specified explicitly, it will override
  any forwarded header value.
  If a LAS file is the result of multiple LAS input files, the header values
  to be forwarded must match or they will be ignored and a default will
  be used instead.

  VLRs can be forwarded by using the special value ``vlr``.  VLRs containing
  the following User IDs are NOT forwarded: ``LASF_Projection``,
  ``liblas``, ``laszip encoded``.  VLRs with the User ID ``LASF_Spec`` and
  a record ID other than 0 or 3 are also not forwarded.  These VLRs are known
  to contain information regarding the formatting of the data and will be rebuilt
  properly in the output file as necessary.  Unlike header values, VLRs from multiple
  input files are accumulated and each is written to the output file.  Forwarded
  VLRs may contain duplicate User ID/Record ID pairs.

software_id
  String identifying the software that created this LAS file.
  [Default: PDAL version num (build num)]"

creation_doy
  Number of the day of the year (January 1 == 1) this file is being created.

creation_year
  Year (Gregorian) this file is being created.

system_id
  String identifying the system that created this LAS file. [Default: "PDAL"]

global_encoding
  Various indicators to describe the data.  See the LAS documentation.  Note
  that PDAL will always set bit four when creating LAS version 1.4 output.
  [Default: 0]

project_id
  UID reserved for the user [Default: Nil UID]

scale_x, scale_y, scale_z
  Scale to be divided from the X, Y and Z nominal values, respectively, after
  the offset has been applied.  The special value ``auto`` can be specified,
  which causes the writer to select a scale to set the stored values of the
  dimensions to range from [0, 2147483647].  [Default: .01]

  Note: written value = (nominal value - offset) / scale.

offset_x, offset_y, offset_z
   Offset to be subtracted from the X, Y and Z nominal values, respectively,
   before the value is scaled.  The special value ``auto`` can be specified,
   which causes the writer to set the offset to the minimum value of the
   dimension.  [Default: 0]

   Note: written value = (nominal value - offset) / scale.

filesource_id
  The file source id number to use for this file (a value between
  0 and 65535 - 0 implies "unassigned") [Default: 0]

pipeline
  Write a JSON representation of the running pipeline as a VLR.

vlrs
    Add VLRS specified as json. See `VLRs`_ above for details.

a_srs
    Spatial reference to use to write output.

threads
    Number of threads to use when writing [Default: 10]

extra_dims
  Extra dimensions to be written as part of each point beyond those specified
  by the LAS point format.  The format of the option is
  ``<dimension_name>=<type> [, ...]``.  Any valid PDAL :ref:`type <types>`
  can be specified.

  The special value ``all`` can be used in place of a dimension/type list
  to request that all dimensions that can't be stored in the predefined
  LAS point record get added as extra data at the end of each point record.

enhanced_srs_vlrs
  Write WKT2 and PROJJSON as VLR [Default: false]

=============

`Draco`_ is a library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric meshes and
point clouds and was designed and built for compression efficiency and speed.
The code supports compressing points, connectivity information, texture coordinates,
color information, normals, and any other generic attributes associated with geometry.

This writer aims to use the encoding feature of the Draco library to compress and
output Draco files.

Example

This example will read in a las file and output a Draco encoded file, with options
to include PDAL dimensions X, Y, and Z as double, and explicitly setting quantization
levels of some of the Draco attributes.

The **EPT Addon Writer** supports writing additional dimensions to
`Entwine Point Tile`_ datasets.  The EPT addon writer may only
be used in a pipeline with an :ref:`EPT reader <readers.ept>`, and it
creates additional attributes for an existing dataset rather than
creating a brand new one.

The addon dimensions created by this writer are stored independently from the corresponding EPT dataset, therefore write-access to the EPT resource itself is not required to create and use addon dimensions.

.. embed::

Example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This example downloads the Autzen dataset (10M points) and runs the
:ref:`SMRF filter <filters.smrf>`, which populates the ``Classification``
dimension with ground values, and writes the resulting attribute to an EPT
addon dataset on the local filesystem.

And here is a follow-up example of reading this dataset with the
:ref:`EPT reader <readers.ept>` with the created addon overwriting the
``Classification`` value.  The output is then written to a single file
with the :ref:`LAS writer <writers.las>`.

================================================================================

The **GDAL writer** creates a raster from a point cloud using an interpolation
algorithm.  Output is produced using `GDAL`_ and can use any `driver
that supports creation of rasters`_.  A data_type_ can be specified for the
raster (double, float, int32, etc.).  If no data type is specified, the
data type with the largest range supported by the driver is used.

.. _`GDAL`: http://gdal.org
.. _`driver that supports creation of rasters`: http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html

The technique used to create the raster is a simple interpolation where
each point that falls within a given radius_ of a raster cell center
potentially contributes to the raster's value.  If no radius is provided,
it is set to the product of the resolution_ and the square root of two.
If a circle with the provided radius
doesn't encompass the entire cell, it is possible that some points will
not be considered at all, including those that may be within the bounds
of the raster cell.

The GDAL writer creates rasters using the data specified in the dimension_
option (defaults to `Z`). The writer creates up to six rasters based on
different statistics in the output dataset.  The order of the layers in the
dataset is as follows:

min
    Give the cell the minimum value of all points within the given radius.

max
    Give the cell the maximum value of all points within the given radius.

mean
    Give the cell the mean value of all points within the given radius.

idw
    Cells are assigned a value based on `Shepard's inverse distance weighting`_
    algorithm, considering all points within the given radius.

count
    Give the cell the number of points that lie within the given radius.

stdev
    Give the cell the population standard deviation of the points that lie
    within the given radius.

.. _`Shepard's inverse distance weighting`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting

If no points fall within the circle about a raster cell, a secondary
algorithm can be used to attempt to provide a value after the standard
interpolation is complete.  If the window_size_ option is non-zero, the
values of a square of rasters surrounding an empty cell is applied
using inverse distance weighting of any non-empty cells.
The value provided for window_size is the
maximum horizontal or vertical distance that a donor cell may be in order to
contribute to the subject cell (A window_size of 1 essentially creates a 3x3
array around the subject cell.  A window_size of 2 creates a 5x5 array, and
so on.)

Cells that have no value after interpolation are given a value specified by
the nodata_ option.

Basic Example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This  pipeline reads the file autzen_trim.las and creates a Geotiff dataset
called outputfile.tif.  Since output_type isn't specified, it creates six
raster bands ("min", "max", "mean", "idx", "count" and "stdev") in the output
dataset.  The raster cells are 10x10 and the radius used to locate points
whose values contribute to the cell value is 14.14.

Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

filename
    Name of output file. The writer will accept a filename containing
    a single placeholder character (`#`).  If input to the writer consists
    of multiple PointViews, each will be written to a separate file, where
    the placeholder will be replaced with an incrementing integer.  If no
    placeholder is found, all PointViews provided to the writer are
    aggregated into a single file for output.  Multiple PointViews are usually
    the result of using :ref:`filters.splitter`, :ref:`filters.chipper` or
    :ref:`filters.divider`.[Required]


binmode:
    If 'true', only points **inside** the raster pixel will be considered
    for statistics, and no distance-based summary or interpolation will
    be applied [Default: false]

.. _resolution:

resolution
    Length of raster cell edges in X/Y units.  [Required]

.. _radius:

radius
    Radius about cell center bounding points to use to calculate a cell value.
    [Default: resolution_ * sqrt(2)]

power
    Exponent of the distance when computing IDW. Close points have higher
    significance than far points. [Default: 1.0]

gdaldriver
    GDAL code of the `GDAL driver`_ to use to write the output.
    [Default: "GTiff"]

.. _`GDAL driver`: http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html

gdalopts
    A list of key/value options to pass directly to the GDAL driver.  The
    format is name=value,name=value,...  The option may be specified
    any number of times.

    .. note::
        The INTERLEAVE GDAL driver option is not supported.  writers.gdal
        always uses BAND interleaving.

.. _data_type:

data_type
    The :ref:`data type <types>` to use for the output raster.
    Many GDAL drivers only
    support a limited set of output data types.
    [Default: depends on the driver]

.. _nodata:

nodata
    The value to use for a raster cell if no data exists in the input data
    with which to compute an output cell value. [Default: depends on the
    data_type_.  -9999 for double, float, int and short, 9999 for
    unsigned int and unsigned short, 255 for unsigned char and -128 for char]

.. _output_type:

output_type
    A comma separated list of statistics for which to produce raster layers.
    The supported values are "min", "max", "mean", "idw", "count", "stdev"
    and "all".  The option may be specified more than once. [Default: "all"]

.. _window_size:

    One of `data`, `filename` or `metadata` must be specified. Data must be
    specified as base64 encoded strings. The content of a file is inserted as
    binary. The metadata key specified must refer to a string or base64 encoded data.


Example
-------

.. code-block:: json

  [
      {
          "type":"readers.las",
          "filename":"inputfile.las"
      },
      {
          "type":"writers.las",
          "filename":"outputfile.las"
      }
  ]


Options
-------

filename
  Output filename. The writer will accept a filename containing
  a single placeholder character (`#`).  If input to the writer consists
  of multiple PointViews, each will be written to a separate file, where
  the placeholder will be replaced with an incrementing integer.  If no
  placeholder is found, all PointViews provided to the writer are
  aggregated into a single file for output.  Multiple PointViews are usually
  the result of using :ref:`filters.splitter`, :ref:`filters.chipper` or
  :ref:`filters.divider`.
  [Required]

_`forward`
  List of header fields whose values should be preserved from a source
  LAS file.  The
  option can be specified multiple times, which has the same effect as
  listing values separated by a comma.  The following values are valid:
  ``major_version``, ``minor_version``, ``dataformat_id``, ``filesource_id``,
  ``global_encoding``, ``project_id``, ``system_id``, ``software_id``, ``creation_doy``,
  ``creation_year``, ``scale_x``, ``scale_y``, ``scale_z``, ``offset_x``, ``offset_y``,
  ``offset_z``.  In addition, the special value ``header`` can be specified,
  which is equivalent to specifying all the values EXCEPT the scale and
  offset values.  Scale and offset values can be forwarded as a group by
  using the special values ``scale`` and ``offset`` respectively.  The special
  value ``all`` is equivalent to specifying ``header``, ``scale``, ``offset`` and
  ``vlr`` (see below).
  If a header option is specified explicitly, it will override any forwarded
  header value.
  If a LAS file is the result of multiple LAS input files, the header values
  to be forwarded must match or they will be ignored and a default will
  be used instead.

  VLRs can be forwarded by using the special value ``vlr``.  VLRs containing
  the following User IDs are NOT forwarded: ``LASF_Projection``,
  ``liblas``, ``laszip encoded``.  VLRs with the User ID ``LASF_Spec`` and
  a record ID other than 0 or 3 are also not forwarded.  These VLRs are known
  to contain information
  regarding the formatting of the data and will be rebuilt properly in the
  output file as necessary.  Unlike header values, VLRs from multiple input
  files are accumulated and each is written to the output file.  Forwarded
  VLRs may contain duplicate User ID/Record ID pairs.

minor_version
  All LAS files are version 1, but the minor version (0 - 4) can be specified
  with this option. [Default: 2]

software_id
  String identifying the software that created this LAS file.
  [Default: PDAL version num (build num)]"

creation_doy
  Number of the day of the year (January 1 == 1) this file is being created.

creation_year
  Year (Gregorian) this file is being created.

dataformat_id
  Controls whether information about color and time are stored with the point
  information in the LAS file. [Default: 3]

  * 0 == no color or time stored
  * 1 == time is stored
  * 2 == color is stored
  * 3 == color and time are stored
  * 4 [Not Currently Supported]
  * 5 [Not Currently Supported]
  * 6 == time is stored (version 1.4+ only)
  * 7 == time and color are stored (version 1.4+ only)
  * 8 == time, color and near infrared are stored (version 1.4+ only)
  * 9 [Not Currently Supported]
  * 10 [Not Currently Supported]

system_id
  String identifying the system that created this LAS file. [Default: "PDAL"]

a_srs
  The spatial reference system of the file to be written. Can be an EPSG string
  (e.g. "EPSG:26910") or a WKT string. [Default: Not set]

global_encoding
  Various indicators to describe the data.  See the LAS documentation.  Note
  that PDAL will always set bit four when creating LAS version 1.4 output.
  [Default: 0]

project_id
  UID reserved for the user [Default: Nil UID]

compression
  Set to "true" to apply compression to the output, creating a LAZ file (using
  the LazPerf compressor) instead of a LAS file.
  For backwards compatibility, "lazperf" or "laszip" are still accepted, but
  those values are treated as "true". [Default: "false"]

scale_x, scale_y, scale_z
  Scale to be divided from the X, Y and Z nominal values, respectively, after
  the offset has been applied.  The special value ``auto`` can be specified,
  which causes the writer to select a scale to set the stored values of the
  dimensions to range from [0, 2147483647].  [Default: .01]

  Note: written value = (nominal value - offset) / scale.

offset_x, offset_y, offset_z
   Offset to be subtracted from the X, Y and Z nominal values, respectively,
   before the value is scaled.  The special value ``auto`` can be specified,
   which causes the writer to set the offset to the minimum value of the
   dimension.  [Default: 0]

   Note: written value = (nominal value - offset) / scale.

filesource_id
  The file source id number to use for this file (a value between
  0 and 65535 - 0 implies "unassigned") [Default: 0]

discard_high_return_numbers
  If true, discard all points with a return number greater than the maximum
  supported by the point format (5 for formats 0-5, 15 for formats 6-10).
  [Default: false]

extra_dims
  Extra dimensions to be written as part of each point beyond those specified
  by the LAS point format.  The format of the option is
  ``<dimension_name>=<type> [, ...]``.  Any valid PDAL :ref:`type <types>`
  can be specified.

  The special value ``all`` can be used in place of a dimension/type list
  to request that all dimensions that can't be stored in the predefined
  LAS point record get added as extra data at the end of each point record.

  PDAL writes an extra bytes VLR (User ID: LASF_Spec, Record ID: 4) when
  extra dims are written.  The VLR describes the extra dimensions specified by
  this option.  Note that reading of this VLR is only specified for LAS
  version 1.4, though some systems will honor it for earlier file formats.
  The :ref:`LAS reader <readers.las>` requires the option
  use_eb_vlr in order to
  read the extra bytes VLR for files written with 1.1 - 1.3 LAS format.

  Setting --verbose=Info will provide output on the names, types and order
  of dimensions being written as part of the LAS extra bytes.

pdal_metadata
  Write two VLRs containing `JSON`_ output with both the :ref:`metadata` and
  :ref:`pipeline` serialization. [Default: false]

vlrs
    Add VLRS specified as json. See `VLRs`_ above for details.

The **PCD Writer** supports writing to `Point Cloud Data (PCD)`_ formatted
files, which are used by the `Point Cloud Library (PCL)`_.

By default, compression is not enabled, and the PCD writer will output ASCII
formatted data.

.. embed::

.. streamable::

.. note::

    X, Y, and Z dimensions will be written as single-precision floats by
    default to be compatible with most of the existing PCL point types. These
    dimensions can be forced to double-precision using the `order` option, but
    the PCL code reading this data must be capable of reading double-precision
    fields (i.e., it is not the responsibility of PDAL to ensure this
    compatibility).

.. note::

    When working with large coordinate values it is recommended that users
    first translate the coordinate values using :ref:`filters.transformation`
    to avoid loss of precision when writing single-precision XYZ data.

Options
-------

filename

compression
  Level of PCD compression to use (ascii, binary, compressed) [Default:

_`precision`
  Decimal Precision for output of values. This can be overridden for individual
  dimensions using the order option. [Default: 2]

_`order`
  Comma-separated list of dimension names in the desired output order. For
  example "X,Y,Z,Red,Green,Blue". Dimension names can optionally be followed
  by a PDAL type (e.g., Unsigned32) and dimension-specific precision (used only
  with "ascii" compression).  Ex: "X=Float:2, Y=Float:2, Z=Float:3,
  Intensity=Unsigned32" If no precision is specified the value provided with
  the precision_ option is used.  The default dimension type is double
  precision float. [Default: none]

====================

The **PostgreSQL Pointcloud Writer** allows you to write to PostgreSQL database
that have the `PostgreSQL Pointcloud`_ extension enabled. The Pointcloud
extension stores point cloud data in tables that contain rows of patches. Each
patch in turn contains a large number of spatially nearby points.

While you can theoretically store the contents of a whole file of points in a
single patch, it is more practical to store a table full of smaller patches,
where the patches are under the PostgreSQL page size (8KB). For most LIDAR
data, this practically means a patch size of between 400 and 600 points.

In order to create patches of the right size, the Pointcloud writer should be
preceded in the pipeline file by :ref:`filters.chipper`.

The pgpointcloud format does not support WKT spatial reference specifications.  A subset of spatial references can be stored by using the 'srid' option, which
allows storage of an `EPSG code`_ that covers many common spatial references.
PDAL makes no attempt to reproject data to your specified srid.  Use
:ref:`filters.reprojection` for this purpose.
