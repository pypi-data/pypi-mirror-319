# NeuralCore Python SDK

The **NeuralCore Python SDK** provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the NeuralCore AI APIs, including chat and vision capabilities. This module enables seamless integration of NeuralCoreâ€™s powerful AI features into your applications.

## Features

- **Chat API**: Send messages and interact with NeuralCore's language models.
- **Vision API**: Analyze images with advanced vision models.
- **Custom Configuration**: Set default parameters like temperature and tokens to customize responses.

## Installation

Clone or download this repository and ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## Usage

### Initialization

To use the NeuralCore Python SDK, initialize the client with your API key:

```python
from neuralcore import NeuralCore

api_key = "your_api_key_here"
client = NeuralCore(api_key)
```

### Chat API

Send a chat request to NeuralCore:

```python
response = client.chat(
    messages="Hello, NeuralCore!",
    model="neura-3.5-aala",
    temperature=0.8,
    tokens=150
)
print(response)
```

### Vision API

Send an image analysis request to NeuralCore:

```python
response = client.vision(
    image_url="https://example.com/image.jpg",
    prompt="Describe the objects in the image.",
    model="neura-vision-3.5",
    temperature=0.7,
    tokens=200
)
print(response)
```

---

## Configuration

You can customize the default settings during initialization:

```python
from neuralcore import NeuralCoreConfig, NeuralCore

config = NeuralCoreConfig(
    api_key="your_api_key_here",
    base_url="https://neuralcore.org/api/n",
    default_temperature=0.6,
    default_tokens=250
)
client = NeuralCore(api_key=config.api_key)
```

---

## Error Handling

The SDK raises a `NeuralCoreError` for any issues with API requests. Example:

```python
try:
    response = client.chat("What's the weather?")
except NeuralCoreError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```
