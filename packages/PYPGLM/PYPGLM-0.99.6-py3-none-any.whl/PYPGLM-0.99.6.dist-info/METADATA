# pypglm (Probabilistic Graphical Logical Models)

## Description

This toolbox is designed to facilitate the modeling of probabilistic, graphical, logical systems.
It is the new version of the tool "FALCON", developed in Matlab in 2017 and described in De Landtsheer et al. in 
Bioinformatics: [here is the link](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/21/3431/3897376).

Example usage: modeling of signaling pathways

## Version info

v0.01 pre-alpha : current development

## Installation and requirements

We advise you to clone the repo to your local machine, set up a virtual environment,
 install the requirements from the 'requirements.txt' file.


## Usage

In order to use pypgml, you will need two things:
- a network file (xls, xlsx, csv, sif) containing the structure of the interaction network.
- a data file (xls, xlsx, csv) containing the values for input nodes and output nodes in the different contexts.

- The file extension for pypglm is ".ðŸ¦…", as a tribute to the original FALCON toolbox.
- 

## Regularizations

The coolest thing with the pypgml is the possibility to apply multiple regularization schemes to the parameters
 of the models. Multiple models, with identical structure, can be optimized together over multiple contexts.

- L1/2: partial norm on parameters. This induces a simplification of the model topology
- L1: simple L1 norm on parameters. This induces a pruning of less important inhibitory edges, but has no effect on stimulatory edges
- L2: Induces a decrease of weights of unimportant inhibitory edges
- L1_groups: Induces an equalization of edge values between contexts when these are discrete (different cell lines)
- L1_smooth: Induces an equalization of edge values between contexts when these are continuous and ordered (different time-points)
- LCluster: Induces a clustering of edge values. See [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2018.00550/full)
