opt `1` to download the compressed comfy pack (7z), decompress it, and run the .bat file striaght (recommended)

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calcuis/comfy/master/gguf-node.png)
check the dropdown menu for `gguf`

#### for technical user/developer(s)
opt `2` to clone the gguf repo to the current directory (navigate to `./ComfyUI/custom_nodes` first)

alternatively, you could execute the git clone command to perform that task (see below):
- navigate to `./ComfyUI/custom_nodes`
- clone the gguf repo to that folder by
```
git clone https://github.com/calcuis/gguf
```
if you opt to clone the repo to custom_nodes (method 2); you need gguf-[connector](https://pypi.org/project/gguf-connector) as well (either install it via pip or just clone the deployment copy, see opt `3` below)
#### optional [if you have gguf-connector installed, you don't need to go through this; btw, deployment copy no command prompt feature]
opt `3` to clone the `gguf-connector` deployment copy (in case you encounter any problem while installing, probably you don't have c/c++ complier or comply it failed, etc. and don't wanna troubleshoot it anymore; or just lazy, then put this copy to your working version python `../site-packages` directory or `./python_embeded/Lib/site-packages` if you are using the portable pack from comfyui)

#### setup (in general)
- drag gguf file(s) to diffusion_models folder (./ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models)
- drag clip or encoder(s) to text_encoders folder (./ComfyUI/models/text_encoders)
- drag controlnet adapter(s), if any, to controlnet folder (./ComfyUI/models/controlnet)
- drag lora adapter(s), if any, to loras folder (./ComfyUI/models/loras)
- drag vae decoder(s) to vae folder (./ComfyUI/models/vae)

#### workflow
- drag the workflow json file to the activated browser; or
- drag any generated output file (i.e., picture, video, etc.; which contains the workflow metadata) to the activated browser

#### simulator
- design your own prompt; or
- generate a random prompt/descriptor by the [simulator](https://prompt.calcuis.us) (though it might not be applicable for all)

#### convertor (new feature: convert safetensors to gguf)
- drag safetensors file(s) to diffusion_models folder (./ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models)
- choose the last option from the gguf menu: `GGUF Convertor (Alpha)`
- select your saftensors model inside the box; don't need to connect anything; it works independently
- click `Queue` (run); then you can simply check the processing progress from console
- when it was done; the converted gguf file will be saved in the output folder (./ComfyUI/output)
