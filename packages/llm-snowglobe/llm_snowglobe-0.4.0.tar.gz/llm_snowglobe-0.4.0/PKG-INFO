# Snow Globe
***Open-Ended Wargames with Large Language Models***

Snow Globe, an ongoing applied research project and resulting software package, uses large language models (LLMs) for automated play of "open-ended" text-based wargames, such as seminar games and political wargames.  LLMs enable a light, flexible architecture in which player actions are not restricted to predefined options.  The system allows humans to play against or alongside AI agents with specific personas.  Every stage of the wargame from scenario preparation to post-game analysis can be optionally carried out by AI, humans, or a combination thereof.

## Installation

Build the Docker image and run a container.

```
./docker_setup.sh
```

Or, install Snow Globe from PyPI.  For CPU only:

```
pip install llm-snowglobe
```

For GPU support:

```
CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_CUDA=on" pip install llm-snowglobe
```

## Demos

After installation, you can simulate a tabletop exercise about an AI incident response.

```
examples/haiwire.py
```

Or, simulate a political wargame about a geopolitical crisis.

```
examples/ac.py
```

In the latter case, you can use the chat interface to discuss the game afterwards, or just press `Enter` twice to exit.

## Human Players

To play a game between a human and an AI player, launch the server and start a game:

```
snowglobe_server &
examples/ac.py --human 1
```

Then, open a browser window and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

The terminal output will include the ID number for the human player.  Type the number into the ID box then click `Connect`.  The top text box gives player prompts; the bottom text box is where the player enters responses.  Text boxes turn blue while waiting for the next prompt.
