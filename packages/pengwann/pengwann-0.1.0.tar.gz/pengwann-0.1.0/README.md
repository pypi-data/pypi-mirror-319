`pengwann` is a lightweight Python package for computing common descriptors of chemical bonding from Wannier functions (as output by [Wannier90](https://wannier.org/)). Alternatively phrased: `pengwann` replicates the core functionality of [LOBSTER](http://www.cohp.de/), except that the local basis used to represent the Hamiltonian and the density matrix is comprised of Wannier functions rather than pre-defined atomic or pseudo-atomic orbitals. The primary advantage of this methodology is that (for energetically isolated bands) **the spilling factor is strictly 0**.

## Installation

The latest tagged release of `pengwann` is `pip`-installable as:

```
pip install pengwann
```

Alternatively, to install the current development build:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/PatrickJTaylor/pengwann.git
```
