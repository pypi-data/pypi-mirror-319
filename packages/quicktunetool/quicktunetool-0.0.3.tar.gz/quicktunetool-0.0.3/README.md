**A Practical Tool and User Guide for Automatically Finetuning Pretrained Models**

> Quick-Tune-Tool is an automated solution for selecting and finetuning pretrained models across various machine learning domains. Built upon the Quick-Tune algorithm, this tool bridges the gap between research-code and practical applications, making model finetuning accessible and efficient for practitioners.


## Installation
```bash
pip install quicktunetool
# or
git clone https://github.com/automl/quicktunetool
pip install -e quicktunetool  # Use -e for editable mode
```


## Usage

A simple example for using Quick-Tune-Tool with a pretrained optimizer for image classification:

```python
from qtt import QuickTuner, get_pretrained_optimizer
from qtt.finetune.image.classification import fn

# Load task information and meta-features
task_info, metafeat = extract_task_info_metafeat("path/to/dataset")

# Initialize the optimizer
optimizer = get_pretrained_optimizer("mtlbm/full")
optimizer.setup(128, metafeat)

# Create QuickTuner instance and run
qt = QuickTuner(optimizer, fn)
qt.run(task_info, time_budget=3600)
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to run QTT on an image dataset in just a few lines of code.
