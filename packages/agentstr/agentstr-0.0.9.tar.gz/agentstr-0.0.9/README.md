AgentStr
========
AgentStr is an extension of [Phidata](https://www.phidata.com) AI agents that allows for agents to communicate with other agents in separate computers using the Nostr communication protocol.

The goal is for Agent A operated by Company A to be able to work with Agent B operated by Company B to achieve a common goal. For example: Company A wants to buy a product sold by Company B so Agent A and Agent B can coordinate and execute the transaction.

# Current status
The library is in its infancy.

Done:
- Workflow to package and distribute the library
- Create AgentStr as an extension of Phidata Agent
- Test the addition of new properties and capabilities for the AgentStr class

To be done:
- Incorporate Nostr capabilities
- Create unique public / private key identifiers for agent instances
- Send and retreive messages via Nostr
- Expose capabilities via Nostr
- Agent B retrieves capabilities exposed by Agent A
- Agent B coordinates transaction with Agent A

# Installation
AgentStr is offered as a python library available at https://pypi.org/project/agentstr/. 

Here is an example on how to use the library:

1. Create a new python environment for your app
    ```
    cd ~/
    python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/aienv
    source ~/.venvs/aienv/bin/acticate
    ```
2. Install the agentstr library
    ```
    pip install agentstr
    mkdir ~/mysampleapp
    cd ~/mysampleapp
    ```
3. Create a new python file
    ```
    touch main.py
    ```
4. Copy paste this code to the main.py file
    ```
    from agentstr.core import AgentStr
    # Create the agent
    agent = AgentStr("Synvya Inc", "Seller")

    # Test AgentStr new capabilities
    print(f"Public key: {agent.get_public_key()}\nPrivate key: {agent.get_private_key()}")
    print(f"Company: {agent.get_company()}\nRole: {agent.get_role()}")

    # Test phidata inherited capabilities
    agent.print_response("Write two sentence poem for  the love between the sun and the moon.") 
    ```
5. Run the code
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
