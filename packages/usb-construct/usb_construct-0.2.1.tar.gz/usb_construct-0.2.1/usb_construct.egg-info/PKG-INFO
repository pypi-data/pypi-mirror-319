# USB Protocol Library for Python

`usb-construct` is a library that collects common data-processing code for USB tasks;
and is meant to support a variety of projects, including USB stacks, analyzers, and
other tools that work with USB data. A primary intention is to unify common code from
LUNA, FaceDancer, and ViewSB.

The library is currently an early work-in-progress; this documentation will be updated
when the project is more mature.
