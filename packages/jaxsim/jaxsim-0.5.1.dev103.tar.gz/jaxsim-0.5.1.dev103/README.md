### JaxSim as a multibody dynamics library

- Provides rigid body dynamics algorithms (RBDAs) like RNEA, ABA, CRBA, and Jacobians.
- Provides all the quantities included in the Euler-PoincarÃ¨ formulation of the equations of motion.
- Supports body-fixed, inertial-fixed, and mixed [velocity representations][notation].
- Exposes all the necessary quantities to develop controllers in centroidal coordinates.
- Supports running open-loop and full closed-loop control architectures on hardware accelerators.

### JaxSim for robot learning

- Being developed with JAX, all the RBDAs support automatic differentiation both in forward and reverse modes.
- Support for automatically differentiating against kinematics and dynamics parameters.
- All fixed-step integrators are forward and reverse differentiable.
- All variable-step integrators are forward differentiable.

## Credits

The RBDAs are based on the theory of the [Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms][RBDA]
book by Roy Featherstone.
The algorithms and some simulation features were inspired by its accompanying [code][spatial_v2].

[RBDA]: https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4899-7560-7

The development of JaxSim started in late 2021, inspired by early versions of [`google/brax`][brax].
At that time, Brax was implemented in maximal coordinates, and we wanted a physics engine in reduced coordinates.
We are grateful to the Brax team for their work and showing the potential of [JAX][jax] in this field.

Brax v2 was later implemented reduced coordinates, following an approach comparable to JaxSim.
The development then shifted to [MJX][mjx], which today provides a JAX-based implementation of the Mujoco APIs.

The main differences between MJX/Brax and JaxSim are as follows:

- JaxSim supports out-of-the-box all SDF models with [Pose Frame Semantics][PFS].
- JaxSim only supports collisions between points rigidly attached to bodies and a compliant ground surface.
  Our contact model requires careful tuning of its spring-damper parameters, but being an instantaneous
  function of the state $(\mathbf{q}, \boldsymbol{\nu})$, it doesn't require running any optimization algorithm
  when stepping the simulation forward.
- JaxSim mitigates the stiffness of the contact-aware system dynamics by providing variable-step integrators.
