Whether you're prototyping internal tools or deploying production-grade apps, Preswald reduces complexity and cost without compromising flexibility.

- Code-First Simplicity. Minimal Python and SQL for powerful apps
- End-to-End Coverage. Handle ingestion, ETL, and visualization in one platform
- Efficient by Design. Avoid the sprawling complexity of the modern data stack while keeping what works.
- Connect to CSV, JSON, Parquet, or SQL databases in seconds.
- Fully Customizable Themes. Your app, your brand‚Äîjust tweak images and names in `config.toml`.
- Go live on your machine with a single command.

# **üöÄ Getting Started**

## **Installation**

First, install Preswald using pip. https://pypi.org/project/preswald/ 

```bash
pip install preswald
```

## **üë©‚Äçüíª Quick Start**

### **1. Initialize a New Project**

Start your journey with Preswald by initializing a new project:

```bash
preswald init my_project
cd my_project
```

This will create a folder called `my_project` with all the basics you need:

- `hello.py`: Your first Preswald app.
- `config.toml`: Customize your app‚Äôs settings and style.
- `secrets.toml`: Keep your API keys and sensitive information safe.
- `.gitignore`: Preconfigured to keep `secrets.toml` out of your Git repository.


### **2. Write Your First App**

Time to make something magical! Open up `hello.py` and write:

```python
from preswald import text, connect, view

# Render Markdown content
text("# Welcome to Preswald")

# Connect to a CSV file
data_conn = connect("example.csv", "my_data")

# Display the data as a table
view(data_conn)
```

### **3. Run Your App**

Now the fun part‚Äîsee it in action! Run your app locally with:

```bash
preswald run hello.py
```

This command launches a development server, and Preswald will let you know where your app is hosted. Typically, it‚Äôs here:

```
üåê App running at: http://localhost:8501
```

Open your browser, and voil√†‚Äîyour first Preswald app is live!



## **üí° Examples**

### **Example 1: Hello World**

```python
from preswald import text

text("# Hello, World!")
```

### **Example 2: Data Viewer**

```python
from preswald import connect, view

data_conn = connect("example.csv", "example_data")
view(data_conn)
```

### **Example 3: Interactive Dashboard**

```python
from preswald import text, slider, view, connect

text("# Interactive Dashboard")

slider_value = slider("Rows to Display", min_val=10, max_val=100, step=10, default=50)
data_conn = connect("example.csv", "data")
view(data_conn, limit=slider_value)
```

## **üîß Configuration**

Preswald uses `config.toml` for project settings and theming. It‚Äôs straightforward, and it makes your app look polished.

### **Sample `config.toml`:**

```
[project]
title = "Preswald Project"
version = "0.1.0"
port = 8501

[branding]
logo = "thumbnail.png"
favicon = "favicon.ico"
name = "My app"

[theme.color]
primary = "#4CAF50"
secondary = "#FFC107"
background = "#FFFFFF"
text = "#000000"

[theme.font]
family = "Arial, sans-serif"
size = "16px"

[connections.postgres_main]
type = "postgres"
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
dbname = "mydb"
user = "user"

# password is stored in secrets.toml

[connections.earthquake_data]
type = "csv"
path = "earthquake_data.csv"
```
