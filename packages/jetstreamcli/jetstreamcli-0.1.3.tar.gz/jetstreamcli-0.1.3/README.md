Jetstream is a sophisticated command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to facilitate the creation of short videos on Roblox without relying on Roblox‚Äôs proprietary solution.

The tool operates by processing a video (or GIF) into a series of individual frames. Subsequently, it utilizes Roblox‚Äôs Cloud API to upload these frames to the platform.

[**Why Jetstream?**](https://imacodr.github.io/Jetstream/)

Roblox videos at their current state are WAY too expensive and offer many limitations for most developers.

Having to spend 2,000 Robux for a short 30-second video or, most likely for many developers, a GIF, is discouraging for indie games because of its expense.

If you'd like to upload something longer than 30 seconds, it gets more expensive.
