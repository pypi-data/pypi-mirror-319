"""
Implementations of this class are responsible for interfacing with various streaming services
and interacting with the authenticated user's data (if applicable).

If a feature is not directly supported by the streaming service, the driver should raise an UnsupportedFeatureException.
Even for features that may not be guaranteed to be supported by all implementations, the default behavior is to raise a NotImplementedError
because it should be up to the individual driver implementations to indicate such limitations by raising an appropriate exception.
