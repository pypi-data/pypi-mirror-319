# Your AI Data Science Team (An Army Of Copilots)

**An AI-powered data science team of copilots that uses agents to help you perform common data science tasks 10X faster**.

**Star ‚≠ê This GitHub (Takes 2 seconds and means a lot).**

*Beta - This Python library is under active development. There may be breaking changes that occur until release of 0.1.0.* 

---

The AI Data Science Team of Copilots includes Agents that specialize data cleaning, preparation, feature engineering, modeling (machine learning), and interpretation of various business problems like:

- Churn Modeling
- Employee Attrition
- Lead Scoring
- Insurance Risk
- Credit Card Risk
- And more

## Free Generative AI For Data Scientists Workshop

If you want to learn how to build AI Agents for your company that performs Data Science, Business Intelligence, Churn Modeling, Time Series Forecasting, and more, [register for my next Generative AI for Data Scientists workshop here.](https://learn.business-science.io/ai-register)

## Data Science Agents

This project is a work in progress. New data science agents will be released soon.

### Coming Soon: Multi-Agents

This is the internals of the Business Intelligence SQL Agent I'm working on:

### Agents Available Now

1. **Data Wrangling Agent:** Merges, Joins, Preps and Wrangles data into a format that is ready for data analysis.
2. **Data Visualization Agent:** Creates visualizations to help you understand your data. Returns JSON serializable plotly visualizations.
3. **Data Cleaning Agent:** Performs Data Preparation steps including handling missing values, outliers, and data type conversions.
4. **Feature Engineering Agent:** Converts the prepared data into ML-ready data. Adds features to increase predictive accuracy of ML models.
5. **SQL Database Agent:** Connects to SQL databases to pull data into the data science environment. Creates pipelines to automate data extraction. Performs Joins, Aggregations, and other SQL Query operations.

### Agents Coming Soon

1. **Data Analyst:** Analyzes data structure, creates exploratory visualizations, and performs correlation analysis to identify relationships.
2. **Machine Learning Agent:** Builds and logs the machine learning models.
3. **Interpretability Agent:** Performs Interpretable ML to explain why the model returned predictions including which features were the most important to the model.
4. **Supervisor:** Forms task list. Moderates sub-agents. Returns completed assignment.

## Installation

``` bash
pip install git+https://github.com/business-science/ai-data-science-team.git --upgrade
```

## Usage

[See all examples here.](/examples)

### Example 1: Feature Engineering with the Feature Engineering Agent

[See the full example here.](/examples/feature_engineering_agent.ipynb)

``` python
feature_engineering_agent = make_feature_engineering_agent(model = llm)

response = feature_engineering_agent.invoke({
    "user_instructions": "Make sure to scale and center numeric features",
    "target_variable": "Churn",
    "data_raw": df.to_dict(),
    "max_retries":3, 
    "retry_count":0
})
```

``` bash
---FEATURE ENGINEERING AGENT----
    * CREATE FEATURE ENGINEER CODE
    * EXECUTING AGENT CODE
    * EXPLAIN AGENT CODE
```

### Example 2: Cleaning Data with the Data Cleaning Agent

[See the full example here.](/examples/data_cleaning_agent.ipynb) 

``` python
data_cleaning_agent = make_data_cleaning_agent(model = llm)

response = data_cleaning_agent.invoke({
    "user_instructions": "Don't remove outliers when cleaning the data.",
    "data_raw": df.to_dict(),
    "max_retries":3, 
    "retry_count":0
})
```

``` bash
---DATA CLEANING AGENT----
    * CREATE DATA CLEANER CODE
    * EXECUTING AGENT CODE
    * EXPLAIN AGENT CODE
```
