## Installation

```console
pip install psychopy-bids
```

For more detailed installation instructions, including guidance on setting up a virtual environment and additional configuration options, visit the [Installation Guide](./installation.md) in the documentation.

## Usage

The psychopy bids plugin can be used to create valid BIDS valid datasets by creating [behavioral](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modality-specific-files/behavioral-experiments.html#example-_behtsv) or [task events](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04-modality-specific-files/05-task-events.html) in Psychopy. This can be done directly in python code or using the psychopy builder.

In code, the *BIDSHandler* can create or extend an existing BIDS dataset, including directory structure and necessary metadata files. Individual BIDS events can be added during the experiment and are passed to the *BIDSHandler* to write event `.tsv` files and accompanying `.json` files.

```py
from psychopy_bids import bids

handler = bids.BIDSHandler(dataset="example_dataset", subject="01", task="A")
handler.createDataset()

events = [
    bids.BIDSTaskEvent(onset=1.0, duration=0.5, event_type="stimulus", response="correct"),
    bids.BIDSTaskEvent(onset=1.0, duration=0, trial_type="trigger")
]

for event in events:
    handler.addEvent(event)

participant_info = {"participant_id": handler.subject, "age": 18}

handler.writeTaskEvents(participant_info=participant_info)

handler.addStimuliFolder(event_file="example_dataset/sub-01/beh/sub-01_task-A_run-1_events.tsv")
handler.addEnvironment()
handler.addTaskCode()
```

In the builder, you can now use the newly added **BIDS components** to add events to a BIDS dataset. The previously used components—**BIDS Task Event** and **BIDS Beh Event**—are deprecated and retained only for backward compatibility.

You can now select the **BIDS Event Type** directly in the **BIDS Event Properties**, streamlining the process.

Using features such as custom columns it is possible to create detailed event tables for BIDS data.
