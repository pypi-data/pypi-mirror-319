# pducontrol

pducontrol is a Python library to control a wide variety of PDUs
Currently we support the following models:

* SWH-1023J-08N1 (Dexlan, seems to be just an OEM rebadged unit)
* PDU81003 (CyberPower)
* NetIO 4C

## Installation

 You can install pducontrol from source:

```sh
make pip
pip install /dist/pducontrol-*.tar.gz
```
or just call the ``refresh_package.sh`` script

## Usage

This package provides both Python and CLI interfaces, here is how you can 
use them:

### In Python

```python
from pducontrol import PDUControlREST
pdu = PDUControlREST("192.168.0.23")
print(pdu.get_all_names())
```

### In CLI

```sh
pducontrol 192.168.0.23 get_name all
```

A configuration file named `pdu_settings.cfg`, containing IP addresses and
credentials can be added in`~/.config/pducontrol/` for ease of use and 
autocompletion. 

An example file is available in `config`.
