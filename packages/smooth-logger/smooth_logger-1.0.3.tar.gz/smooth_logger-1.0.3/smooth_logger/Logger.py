    Class for controlling the entirety of logging. The logging works on a scope-based system where
    (almost) every message has a defined scope, and the scopes are each associated with a specific
    category defined by the smooth_logger.enums.Categories class. The categories' meanings are as
    follows:

    Categories.DISABLED: do not print to console or save to log file
    Categories.PRINT: print to console but do not save to log file
    Categories.SAVE:  save to log file but do not print to console
    Categories.MAXIMUM: print to console and save to log file

    Note that the old Categories.ENABLED category is deprecated and its functionality has been
    replaced with Categories.PRINT. It will be removed in a later version.
