    For a Local Orbital Frame e.g. QSW (a.k.a. RTN), inertial means that the rotation rate w.r.t.  inertial is ignored when converting velocities. For LVLH frames, the CCSDS standard is adopted.<br> - ```CIRF```: Celestial Intermediate Reference Frame. this is a quasi-inertial Earth-centred system. - ```EME2000```: Earth Mean Equator and Equinox at epoch J2000. The J2000 frame is realized by the transformational algorithm between it and the Earth Fixed frame. - ```GCRF```: Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame. It is a standard inertial coordinate system for the Earth, with origin at the geocenter. - ```GTOD```: Greenwich True-of-Date. It is a rotating, right-handed, Cartesian system with the origin at the Earth's center. - ```ITRF2020```: International Terrestrial Reference Frame. It is a rotating Earth-Fixed frame with data from 2020 used in the frame formation. - ```LVLH_INERTIAL```: Constant for LVLH frame considered inertial (Z axis aligned with opposite of position, Y axis aligned with opposite of orbital momentum) - ```LVLH_ROTATING```: Constant for LVLH frame (Z axis aligned with opposite of position, Y axis aligned with opposite of orbital momentum) - ```QSW_INERTIAL```: Constant for QSW frame considered inertial (X axis aligned with position, Z axis aligned with orbital momentum) - ```QSW_ROTATING```: Constant for QSW frame (X axis aligned with position, Z axis aligned with orbital momentum) - ```TNW_INERTIAL```: Constant for TNW frame considered inertial (X axis aligned with velocity, Z axis aligned with orbital momentum) - ```TNW_ROTATING```: Constant for TNW frame (X axis aligned with velocity, Z axis aligned with orbital momentum)
