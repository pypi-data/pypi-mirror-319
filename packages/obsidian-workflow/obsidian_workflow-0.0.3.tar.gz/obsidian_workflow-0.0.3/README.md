# Obsidian Workflow

Obsidian Workflow is a command line application to automate my obsidian workflows. This application is specific to my workflow and might not fit yours. See each command for more details.

## Commands

### Daily

The daily note in Obsidian serves as a scratchpad for capturing ideas and information throughout the day. Each train of thought is organized under a top-level heading and linked to relevant indexes, maps of content (MOCs), projects, and other atomic notes. This flexible approach allows for quick note-taking without worrying about where in the hierarchy to create a one. However, keeping content in the daily note creates an issue with backlinks, as references show the date (e.g., 2025-01-01-Monday) rather than descriptive titles, making them harder to recognize in linked mentions or unmapped backlink views. To resolve this, each top-level heading is extracted into its own standalone note with a meaningful name. This improves backlink readability and prepares the notes for migration to a folder in the permanent hierarchy when necessary during gardening.

Daily Note Format: YYYY/MM-MMMM/YYYY-MM-DD-dddd

See (Python Scripter Plugin directory)[./plugins/python scripter/README.md] for how to use this within the Obsidian application.
