## Disclaimer

The developers of this module are in no way endorsed by or affiliated with Cookidoo or Vorwerk, or any associated subsidiaries, logos or trademarks.

## Installation

`pip install cookidoo-api`

## Documentation

See below for usage examples.

## Usage Example

The API is based on the `aiohttp` library.

Make sure to have stored your credentials in the top-level file `.env` as such, to loaded by `dotenv`. Alternatively, provide the environment variables by any other `dotenv` compatible means.

```text
EMAIL=your@mail.com
PASSWORD=password
```

Run the [example script](https://github.com/miaucl/cookidoo-api/blob/master/example.py) and have a look at the inline comments for more explanation.

## Exceptions

In case something goes wrong during a request, several [exceptions](https://github.com/miaucl/cookidoo/blob/master/cookidoo_api/exceptions.py) can be thrown, all inheriting from `CookidooException`.

### Another asyncio event loop is

With the async calls, you might encounter an error that another asyncio event loop is already running on the same thread. This is expected behavior according to the asyncio.run() [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run). You cannot use more than one aiohttp session per thread, reuse the existing one!

### Exception ignored: RuntimeError: Event loop is closed

Due to a known issue in some versions of aiohttp when using Windows, you might encounter a similar error to this:

```python
Exception ignored in: <function _ProactorBasePipeTransport.__del__ at 0x00000000>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\...\py38\lib\asyncio\proactor_events.py", line 116, in __del__
    self.close()
  File "C:\...\py38\lib\asyncio\proactor_events.py", line 108, in close
    self._loop.call_soon(self._call_connection_lost, None)
  File "C:\...\py38\lib\asyncio\base_events.py", line 719, in call_soon
    self._check_closed()
  File "C:\...\py38\lib\asyncio\base_events.py", line 508, in _check_closed
    raise RuntimeError('Event loop is closed')
RuntimeError: Event loop is closed
```

You can fix this according to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68123296/asyncio-throws-runtime-error-with-exception-ignored) StackOverflow answer by adding the following line of code before executing the library:

```python
asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())
```

## Dev

Setup the dev environment using VSCode, it is highly recommended.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
```

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)

```bash
pre-commit install

# Run the commit hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Raw API Requests

The raw requests intercepted between the Cookidoo Android App and the backend can be found here `./docs/raw-api-requests`. They have been used to reconstruct the API which is implemented in this library.

### Releasing

It is only possible to release a _final version_ on the `master` branch. For it to pass the gates of the `publish` workflow, it must have the same version in the `tag`, the `cookidoo_api/__init__.py` and an entry in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.

To release a prerelease version, no changelog entry is required, but it can only happen on a feature branch (**not** `master` branch). Also, prerelease versions are marked as such in the github release page.
