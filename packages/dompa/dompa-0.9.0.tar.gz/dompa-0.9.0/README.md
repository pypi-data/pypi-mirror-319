# Dompa

![Coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/askonomm/dompa/refs/heads/master/coverage-badge.svg)

A zero-dependency HTML5 document parser. It takes an input of an HTML string, parses it into a node tree, and provides
an API for querying and manipulating said node tree.

## Install

```shell
pip install dompa
```

Requires Python 3.10 or higher.

## Usage

The most basic usage looks like this:

```python
from dompa import Dompa
from dompa.actions import ToHtml

dom = Dompa("<div>Hello, World</div>")

# Get the tree of nodes
nodes = dom.get_nodes()

# Turn the node tree into HTML
html = dom.action(ToHtml)
```

## DOM manipulation

You can run queries on the node tree to get or manipulate node(s).

### `query`

You can find nodes with the `query` method which takes a `Callable` that gets `Node` passed to it and that has to return
a boolean `true` or `false`, like so:

```python
from dompa import Dompa

dom = Dompa("<h1>Site Title</h1><ul><li>...</li><li>...</li></ul>")
list_items = dom.query(lambda n: n.name == "li")
```

All nodes returned with `query` are deep copies, so mutating them has no effect on Dompa's state.

### `traverse`

The `traverse` method is very similar to the `query` method, but instead of returning deep copies of data it returns a
direct reference to data instead, meaning it is ideal for updating the node tree inside of Dompa. It takes a `Callable`
that gets a `Node` passed to it, and has to return the updated node, like so:

```python
from typing import Optional
from dompa import Dompa
from dompa.nodes import Node, TextNode

dom = Dompa("<h1>Site Title</h1><ul><li>...</li><li>...</li></ul>")


def update_title(node: Node) -> Optional[Node]:
    if node.name == "h1":
        node.children = [TextNode(value="New Title")]

    return node


dom.traverse(update_title)
```

If you wish to remove a node then return `None` instead of the node. If you wish to replace a single node with multiple
nodes, use [`FragmentNode`](#fragmentnode).

## Types of nodes

There are three types of nodes that you can use in Dompa to manipulate the node tree.

### `Node`

The most common node is just `Node`. You should use this if you want the node to potentially have any children inside of
it.

```python
from dompa.nodes import Node

Node(name="name-goes-here", attributes={}, children=[])
```

Would render:

```html

<name-goes-here></name-goes-here>
```

### `VoidNode`

A void node (or _Void Element_ according
to [the HTML standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#void-elements)) is self-closing, meaning you
would not have any children in it.

```python
from dompa.nodes import VoidNode

VoidNode(name="name-goes-here", attributes={})
```

Would render:

```html

<name-goes-here>
```

You would use this to create things like `img`, `input`, `br` and so forth, but of course you can also create custom
elements. Dompa does not enforce the use of any known names.

### `TextNode`

A text node is just for rendering text. It has no tag of its own, it cannot have any attributes and no children.

```python
from dompa.nodes import TextNode

TextNode(value="Hello, World!")
```

Would render:

```html
Hello, World!
```

### `FragmentNode`

A fragment node is a node whose children will replace itself. It is sort of a transient node in a sense that it doesn't
really exist. You can use it to replace a single node with multiple nodes on the same level inside of the `traverse`
method.

```python
from dompa.nodes import TextNode, FragmentNode, Node

FragmentNode(children=[
    Node(name="h2", children=[TextNode(value="Hello, World!")]),
    Node(name="p", children=[TextNode(value="Some content ...")])
])
```

Would render:

```html
<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
<p>Some content ...</p>
```

## Serializers

Both Dompa and its nodes have support for serializers - a way to transform data to whatever you want.

### Dompa Serializers

You can create a Dompa serializer by extending the abstract class `dompa.Serializer` with your serializer class, like
for
example:

```python
from dompa import Serializer
from dompa.nodes import Node


class MySerializer(Serializer):
    def __init__(self, nodes: list[Node]):
        self.nodes = nodes

    def serialize(self):
        pass
```

Basically, a Dompa serializer gets the node tree, and has a `serialize` method that does transforms it into something.

#### `ToHtml`

Dompa comes with a built-in serializer to transform the node tree into a HTML string.

Example usage:

```python
from dompa import Dompa
from dompa.serializers import ToHtml

template = Dompa("<h1>Hello World</h1>")
html = template.serialize(ToHtml)
```

### Node Serializers

Node serializers are basically identical to Dompa serializers, except that they are in a different namespace and, when
Dompa
serializers work with a node tree, Node serializers work with a singular node (and its children, if it has any).

You can create a Node serializer by extending the abstract class `dompa.nodes.Serializer` with your serializer class,
like
for example:

```python
from dompa.nodes import Node, Serializer


class MySerializer(Serializer):
    def __init__(self, node: Node):
        self.node = node

    def serialize(self):
        pass
```

A `Node` serializer is very much like a `Dompa` serializer. Unlike the `Dompa` serializer, which gets a node tree to
work with, a `Node` serializer gets a singular node.

#### `ToHtml`

Dompa comes with a built-in serializer to transform a node into a HTML string.

Example use:

```python
from dompa import Dompa
from dompa.nodes.serializers import ToHtml

template = Dompa("<h1>Hello World</h1>")
h1_node = template.query(lambda x: x.name == "h1")[0]
html = h1_node.serialize(ToHtml)
```
