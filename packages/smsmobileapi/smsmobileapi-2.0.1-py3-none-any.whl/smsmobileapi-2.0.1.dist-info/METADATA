# SMS Mobile API

**SMS Mobile API** is a Python module that allows developers to send SMS messages, retrieve received SMS messages, and send WhatsApp messages via the SMS Mobile API.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install the SMS Mobile API App
Before using this module, **you must first install the SMS Mobile API mobile app** on your Android or iOS device. This app is required to connect your phone to the API for sending and receiving SMS messages.

- [Download SMS Mobile API for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smsmobileapiapp)
- [Download SMS Mobile API for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sms-mobile-api/id6667092442)

Once the app is installed and configured, you can obtain your API key from within the app to use with this Python module.

### 2. Connect Your WhatsApp Account (Optional for WhatsApp Integration)
The connection to WhatsApp is handled through the **SMS Mobile API dashboard**.  
This process does **not require a WhatsApp Business account** or identity verification. Thanks to our simplified and secure authentication process, you can quickly link your WhatsApp account and start sending WhatsApp messages without any per-message costs.

To set up your WhatsApp connection:
1. Create a new account in the SMS Mobile API app (or use the account already set up for managing SMS if you have one).

2. Configure a connection with WhatsApp through the **WhatsApp Config** menu in the dashboard:  
   [Connect WhatsApp Here](https://smsmobileapi.com/connect/)

Once configured, you'll be able to send WhatsApp messages seamlessly through our API.

## Good to Know: WhatsApp Integration
When entering phone numbers for WhatsApp messages:
- **Start with the country code**, but without the `+` or `00`.  
- Follow it directly with the rest of the number.

**Example**: For a number in the USA:  
If the phone number is `+1 555-123-4567`, enter it as `15551234567`.

## Installation

You can install the module directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install smsmobileapi
