# xai-gpt-shap

**xai-gpt-shap** is a Python library for explainable AI (XAI) that combines **SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value analysis with OpenAI GPT-based explanations to make machine learning model predictions more interpretable.

This library allows you to:
- Perform SHAP analysis on machine learning models.
- Generate role-specific explanations for SHAP results using OpenAI GPT (e.g., for beginners, analysts, or researchers).
- Interactively explore and understand SHAP results via a command-line interface (CLI).

## Key Features

- **SHAP Integration**: Calculate SHAP values for any machine learning model and dataset.
- **OpenAI GPT Integration**: Automatically explain SHAP results using OpenAI GPT with role-specific messages (e.g., beginner, analyst, executive summary).
- **Interactive Chat**: Engage in an interactive conversation with GPT to further explore results.
- **CLI Support**: Easily run SHAP analysis and explanations directly from the command line.
