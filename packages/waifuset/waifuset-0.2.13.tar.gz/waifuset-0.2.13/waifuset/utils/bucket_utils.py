    Get the closest resolution to the image's resolution from the buckets. If the image's aspect ratio is too
    different from the closest resolution, then return the around resolution based on the max resolution.

    :param buckets: The buckets of resolutions to choose from. Default to SDXL_BUCKETS. Set None to use max_resolution.
    :param max_resolution: The max resolution to be used to calculate the around resolution. It's used to calculate the 
        around resolution when `buckets` is None or no bucket can contain that image without exceeding the max aspect ratio.
        Default to 1024. Set `-1` to auto calculate from the buckets' max resolution. Set None to disable.
        Set None to auto calculate from the buckets' max resolution.
    :param max_aspect_ratio: The max aspect ratio difference between the image and the closest resolution. Default to 1.1.
        Set None to disable.
    :param divisible: The divisible number of bucket resolutions. Default to 32.
    :return: The closest resolution to the image's resolution.
