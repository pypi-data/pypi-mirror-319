# Equimo: Modern Vision Models in JAX/Equinox

**WARNING**: This is a research library implementing recent computer vision models. The implementations are based on paper descriptions and may not be exact replicas of the original implementations. Use with caution in production environments.

Equimo (Equinox Image Models) provides JAX/Equinox implementations of recent computer vision models, currently focusing (but not limited to) on transformer and state-space architectures.

## Features

- Pure JAX/Equinox implementations
- Focus on recent architectures (2023-2024 papers)
- Modular design for easy experimentation
- Extensive documentation and type hints

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install equimo
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clementpoiret/equimo.git
cd equimo
pip install -e .
```

*: Only contains the [Linear Angular Attention](https://github.com/clementpoiret/Equimo/blob/f8fcc79e45ca65e9deb1d970c4286c0b8562f9c2/equimo/layers/attention.py#L1407) module. It is straight forward to build a ViT around it, but may require an additional `__call__` kwarg to control the `sparse_reg` bool.

## Basic Usage

```python
import jax

import equimo.models as em

# Create a model (e.g. `faster_vit_0_224`)
key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
model = em.FasterViT(
    img_size=224,
    in_channels=3,
    dim=64,
    in_dim=64,
    depths=[2, 3, 6, 5],
    num_heads=[2, 4, 8, 16],
    hat=[False, False, True, False],
    window_size=[7, 7, 7, 7],
    ct_size=2,
    key=key,
)

# Generate random input
x = jax.random.normal(key, (3, 224, 224))

# Run inference
output = model(x, enable_dropout=False, key=key)
```
