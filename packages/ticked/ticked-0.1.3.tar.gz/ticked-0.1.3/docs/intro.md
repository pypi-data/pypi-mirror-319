# Ticked ðŸ“¼

A terminal-based productivity suite built with Textual, designed for STEM students who need a focused work environment.

## Motivation

Most productivity applications offer too few features, leaving critical gaps for what I expect out of a productivity manager. Tick aims to provide essential tools - task management, a pomodoro timer, Spotify integration, and note-taking/code-editing capabilities - in a single, distraction-free terminal interface.

## Core Features

- Task Management with detailed insights and customization options
- Pomodoro Timer with the ability to set your own settings
- Spotify Integration via Spotipy and their Web API (Premium users only, see Spotify section below for more info)
- Note-taking & Code Editing - Syntax highlighting, vim motions, autocomplete, and more features soon
- Terminal-based Interface - All ran in your terminal without the need for credentials. All database data is held locally on your machine.

## Technical Background

Initially developed in C with ncurses, then migrated to Python with pycurses, Ticked found its final form using [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io) - a modern TUI framework that enables rapid development without sacrificing functionality or aesthetics. It is _insanely_ fun to develop with Textual.

## Development

Please read the [Development Guide](development.md) if you'd like to contribute or work with the code yourself. It is open source under the MIT license.
