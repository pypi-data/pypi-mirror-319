# Async Comlink

Async Comlink is an asynchronous Python wrapper for the [swgoh-comlink](https://github.com/swgoh-utils/swgoh-comlink) service. It provides a convenient way for making API requests and includes built-in support for HMAC authentication, enabling secure communication with the service.

## Features

- Fully asynchronous, non-blocking API requests via `aiohttp`
- Compact JSON serialization for compatibility with the API
- Parameter validation to prevent invalid requests
- Debug mode to log requests and help with troubleshooting
- Support for HMAC authentication to ensure secure communication

## Installation
Async Comlink is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/async-comlink/):
```bash
pip install async-comlink
```
Dependencies: aiohttp

## Usage
Basic example of using Async Comlink to make an API request:
```python
import asyncio
from async_comlink import AsyncComlink

async def main():
    # Basic use (for long-lived usage)
    comlink = AsyncComlink()
    response = await comlink.get_player(allycode=123456789)

    # Context manager use (for short-lived usage)
    async with AsyncComlink() as comlink:
        response = await comlink.get_player(allycode=123456789)

asyncio.run(main())
```
