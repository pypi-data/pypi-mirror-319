Description: # Amistock
        
        Amistock is a Python module that allows you to interact with stock market data through a Django-based API. It provides various functions to retrieve stock information, historical data, and more by making API calls.
        
        ## Features
        
        - **Get stock information**: Retrieve detailed information about a stock, including its name, symbol, and other metadata.
        - **Get historical stock data**: Retrieve the stock data (OHLCV) for a given stock over a specified date range.
        - **Get stocks by market**: Fetch stocks associated with a specific market (e.g., HOSE, HNX).
        - **API key authentication**: Use API keys to authenticate requests for accessing stock data.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install the `amistock` module directly from PyPI using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install amistock
        
        Usage
        Getting Stock Information
        You can retrieve information about a stock by symbol using the get_stock_info() function:
        
        python
        Sao chép mã
        import amistock
        
        symbol = 'AAPL'  # Example stock symbol
        api_key = 'your_api_key'
        
        stock_info = amistock.get_stock_info(symbol, api_key)
        print(stock_info)
        Getting Historical Stock Data
        To retrieve historical stock data (OHLCV) for a given stock symbol within a date range:
        
        python
        Sao chép mã
        import amistock
        from datetime import datetime
        
        symbol = 'AAPL'
        api_key = 'your_api_key'
        from_date = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
        to_date = datetime(2021, 1, 1)
        
        stock_data = amistock.get_stock_data(symbol, from_date, to_date, api_key)
        print(stock_data)
        Getting Stocks by Market
        You can fetch all stocks associated with a particular market:
        
        python
        Sao chép mã
        import amistock
        
        market = 'HOSE'  # Example market
        api_key = 'your_api_key'
        
        stocks = amistock.get_stocks_by_market(market, api_key)
        print(stocks)
        Authentication
        Each request made to the API requires an API key for authentication. Make sure to pass a valid API key when calling any of the functions above.
