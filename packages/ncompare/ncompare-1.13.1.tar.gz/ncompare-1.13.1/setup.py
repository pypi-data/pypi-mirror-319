However, note that\n`h5diff` provides comparison of some otherwise "hidden" hdf5 properties, such as _Netcdf4Dimid or _Netcdf4Coordinates,\nwhich are not currently assessed by `ncompare`.\n\n## Notes and known limitations\n\n- `ncompare` works successfully with select HDF5 files,\n  although it has not been tested extensively; therefore,\n  it would not be surprising to find additional limitations with other HDF files.\n- `ncompare` uses `xarray` to access the root-level dimensions.\nIn some cases, `xarray` will miss dimensions whose names do not also exist as variable names in the dataset\n  (also known as non-coordinate dimensions).\n- Some underlying HDF5 properties, such as _Netcdf4Dimid or _Netcdf4Coordinates, are not currently assesssed by `ncompare`.\n\n# Notices:\n\nCopyright 2023 United States Government as represented by the Administrator of the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.
