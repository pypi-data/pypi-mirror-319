# Zinny Web UI: A Simple Interface to Rate Films
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## What's the skinny on the cin√©?
Zinny Web UI provides a straightforward browser-based interface for rating films using surveys from [zinny-surveys](https://github.com/RyLaney/zinny-surveys). It connects to the Zinny API to manage surveys, ratings, and more.
