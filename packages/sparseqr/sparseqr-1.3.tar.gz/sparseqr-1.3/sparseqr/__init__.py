"""Python bindings for SuiteSparse QR routines.

Exported functions:
    sparseqr.qr                              QR decompose sparse matrix
    sparseqr.solve                           solve linear system, LHS sparse
    sparseqr.permutation_vector_to_matrix    utility for conversion

The solver works also for overdetermined linear systems,
making it useful for solving linear least-squares problems.

In solve(), the RHS can be dense or sparse.

See the docstrings of the individual functions for details.
