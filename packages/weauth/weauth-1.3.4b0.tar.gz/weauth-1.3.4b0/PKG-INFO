WeAuth is a bridge between WeChat Official Accounts and your Minecraft server.

Your Minecraft server should've been installed with [MCManager](https://github.com/MCSManager/MCSManager).
WeAuth uses the api of MCManager to connect with game server.

Later on, WeAuth will support Rcon to connect Minecraft server.

```
You can configure your WeChatDeveloper information and game server in `config.yaml`.
```commandline
vi ops.yaml
```
You should also fill in the IDs of In-Game admins in `ops.yaml`.
For example:
```commandline

```
After configuration, run WeAuth again.
