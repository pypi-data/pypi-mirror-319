1. Grocery shopping: The plan was to purchase ingredients such as vegetables, meat, and spices. The history shows that Alex successfully bought carrots, chicken breasts, and garlic from the supermarket.
2. Cooking the meal: The dish required chopping the vegetables and saut√©ing them with the chicken. Alex followed this step and cooked the chicken with the carrots and garlic in a pan, ensuring everything was well-cooked.
3. Plating the dish: The next step involved arranging the cooked meal beautifully on a plate. Alex skillfully plated the chicken and vegetables, making it visually appealing.
4. Eating the meal: There is no record indicating that Alex sat down to eat the meal after plating it. 
Conclusion: Based on the above assessment, the <query> has not been fully achieved. While shopping, cooking, and plating were completed, the final step of eating the meal has not been recorded.
