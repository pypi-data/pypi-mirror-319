    """
    Compute the Radial Difference Local Binary Pattern (RDLBP) for an image with a focus on the smallest radius.

    This function calculates the RDLBP descriptor for an image by comparing the radial differences between
    the original image and a smoothed version of the image. The descriptor is computed using a circular neighborhood
    defined by the given radius and number of points.

    Args:
        imgCenSmooth (numpy.ndarray): Smoothed image from which the radial difference is computed.
        img (numpy.ndarray): Original image for extracting circularly interpolated blocks.
        lbpRadius (int): Radius of the circular neighborhood for Local Binary Pattern (LBP).
        lbpPoints (int): Number of points used in the LBP pattern.
        mapping (dict or None): Optional mapping dictionary for converting LBP result to a different bin scheme.
            Must contain 'num' (number of bins) and 'table' (mapping from old bin to new bin). If None, no mapping is applied.
        mode (str): Output mode. 'h' or 'hist' for histogram of the RDLBP, 'nh' for normalized histogram.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: RDLBP descriptor, either as a histogram or image depending on the `mode` parameter.

    Example:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from skimage import data
        >>> img = data.camera()
        >>> imgCenSmooth = data.coins()
        >>> lbpRadius = 1
        >>> lbpPoints = 8
        >>> mapping = {'num': 256, 'table': np.arange(256)}
        >>> hist = RDLBP_Image_SmallestRadiusOnly(imgCenSmooth, img, lbpRadius, lbpPoints, mapping, mode='nh')
        >>> print(hist.shape)
        (256,)
