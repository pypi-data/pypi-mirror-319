# PyPI: IID42

PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/iid42

Sample:
```
# pip install iid42
import iid

# Send IID to a UDP Gate Relay
target = SendUdpIID("127.0.0.1",3615)
target.push_integer(42)
target.push_index_integer(2,42)
target.push_index_integer_date_local_now(0,42)
target.set_ntp_offset_tick(45453)
target.push_index_integer_date_ntp_now(0,42)
target.push_index_integer_date_ntp_in_seconds(0,42,1.25)
target.push_index_integer_date_ntp_in_milliseconds(0,42,250)

```


**IID**, short for **Index Integer Date**, is a 4/8/12/16-byte format designed for seamless communication across various network systems, including UDP, WebSocket, and Mirror.

By standardizing the code and API to work exclusively with integer values:
- It enables the creation of action index tables.
- It supports the development of specialized tools for specific tasks, allowing IID to facilitate remote actions effectively.

The **IID format** was developed to streamline QA testing across multiple devices and computers with precise timing coordination.

### Key Features of IID:
1. **Index on your own server**: Identifies the target device.
2. **Index on a shared server**: Identifies the user.
3. **Value**: Represents the transported integer value.
4. **Date**: Encoded in a specific `ulong` format:
   - **01.....TICK**: Sent using NTP time.
   - **02.....TICK**: Intended for execution at a designated NTP time.
   - **.......TICK**: Sent from an unknown source time but uses `DateTime.Now` in UTC since 1970.

Since 2024, all my tools have been built around this principle.
