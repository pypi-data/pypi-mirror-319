**ezserialization** - Simple, easy to use & transparent python objects serialization & deserialization.

## About

EzSerialization is meant to be simple in features and usage. It follows these three ideas:

- **Python dicts based**. This package only helps to serialize objects to dicts. 
  Converting them to JSON, XML, etc. is left to the user.
- **Transparent serialization logic**. It does not have automatic `from_dict()` & `to_dict()` methods that convert class 
  instances of any kind to dicts. Implementing them is left to the end-user, thus being transparent with what actually 
  happens with this data.
- **Thread-safe**. Serialization, deserialization & its enabling/disabling is thread-safe.  

All EzSerialization do is it wraps `to_dict()` & `from_dict()` methods for selected classes to inject, register and 
use class type information for deserialization.

## Install

Simply install from PyPI via pip command:
```sh
pip install ezserialization
```

Or use Poetry:
```sh
poetry install
```

## Usage

To use this package:

- implement `Serializable` protocol for your classes by having defined `to_dict()` and 
  `from_dict()` methods;
- decorate your classes with `@serializable`.

During serialization, simply use your implemented `to_dict()` method, and it will return 
your defined dict `{'some_value': 'wow', ...}`  injected with class type information 
`{'_type_': 'example.module.Example', 'some_value': 'wow', ...}`.

During de-serialization (via `deserialize()` method) the modified dict's `_type_` property will be removed and used 
to import `example.module` module dynamically. Finally, the found `Example` class' `from_dict()` method will be used 
to create new object from the original dict.

Here's an example:

```python
from pprint import pprint
from typing import Mapping
from ezserialization import serializable, deserialize, no_serialization

@serializable
class Example:
    def __init__(self, value: str):
        self.value = value

    def to_dict(self) -> dict:
        return {"some_value": self.value}

    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, src: Mapping):
        return cls(value=src["some_value"])


obj = Example("wow")

# Serialization without ability to automatically deserialize:
with no_serialization():
    raw_obj_dict = obj.to_dict()
pprint(raw_obj_dict, indent=2)
# Output:
# {'some_value': 'wow'}

# Serialization WITH automatic deserialization:
obj_dict = obj.to_dict()
pprint(obj_dict, indent=2)
# Output:
# {'_type_': '__main__.Example', 'some_value': 'wow'}

obj2 = deserialize(obj_dict)
print(obj.value == obj2.value)
# Output:
# True
```

### Context managing

EzSerialization supports two context managers:
- `with no_serialization(): ...` - disables injecting class type metadata into the result of `to_dict()` method. 
  Leaves the result dict unfit to be deserialized automatically via `deserialize()`;
- `with use_serialization(): ...` - opposite of `no_serialization()`, enables class type metadata injection. 
  Useful when using inside the disabled serialization scope.

## Configuration

Currently only a single option is available for customizing `ezserialization`:
- `ezserialization.type_field_name` - by default it is set to `_type_`, however if user's solution has `to_dict()` 
  methods that already contain such field, an alternative field name can be set to override the default one.
