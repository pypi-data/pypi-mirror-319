tldrr – Enhanced TLDR with GPT-Powered Examples

tldrr is a command-line tool that extends the functionality of the popular tldr command by providing enhanced, GPT-generated examples for command-line tools. It queries tldr to get concise command examples and supplements them with additional, more detailed scenarios powered by OpenAI’s GPT models.

🚀 Features
    •    Concise tldr-Style Output – GPT responses are formatted to match the tldr style for easy readability.
    •    Interactive Mode – Users can request additional examples (y/n prompt) until satisfied.
    •    Caching – Results are cached for 30 days to reduce redundant API calls and improve performance.
    •    Seamless Integration – Works like the tldr command but with added AI-driven insights.
    •    Configurable – Users can clear the cache or disable GPT-enhanced examples for offline use.

🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tldrr.git
cd tldrr

2. Install the Tool Locally

pip install .

3. Ensure tldr is Installed

sudo apt install tldr  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install tldr      # macOS
scoop install tldr     # Windows

🔑 API Key Setup

tldrr uses the OpenAI API to generate enhanced examples.
    1.    Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/.
    2.    Export the API key as an environment variable:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

    3.    Add the export line to your .bashrc or .zshrc to make it persistent:

echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

📦 Usage

Basic Command

tldrr <command>

Example:

tldrr tcpdump

    •    This queries tldr for tcpdump and enhances the output with additional GPT-generated examples.

Prompt for More Examples

Would you like more examples? (y/n):

    •    Press y to fetch more examples.
    •    Press n to exit the loop.

Clear Cache

tldrr --clear-cache

    •    This clears cached tldr and GPT results.

🧑‍💻 Example Output

tldrr ls

--- TLDR Output ---

- List files in the current directory:
    ls

- List all files, including hidden ones:
    ls -a

--- Enhanced Examples from GPT ---

- List files sorted by size:
    ls -lS

- List files by modification time:
    ls -lt

Would you like more examples? (y/n): y

--- Additional Examples from GPT ---

- List directories only:
    ls -d */

- List files recursively in subdirectories:
    ls -R

⚙️ Configuration Options
    •    Cache Expiry – Cached results expire after 30 days by default.
    •    Offline Mode – If GPT is unavailable, the script falls back to tldr results.
    •    Interactive Prompt – Users can continuously query GPT for more examples or stop when satisfied.

🐛 Troubleshooting
    •    Command Not Found: Ensure tldr is installed and in your system’s PATH.
    •    Invalid API Key: Double-check your OpenAI API key and re-export it.
    •    Repeating GPT Results: The script dynamically prompts GPT for new examples to avoid redundancy.

🌟 Why Use tldrr?
    •    Advanced Learning – Get more comprehensive command-line examples beyond standard tldr outputs.
    •    Saves Time – Quickly grasp complex command-line options with curated, GPT-driven insights.
    •    Interactive and Scalable – Request as much or as little detail as you need.
