    "Introduction of a drug directly into venous circulation over the time duration of more than 30 minutes but less than 24 hours. Method results in 100% bioavailability of the agent due to an absence of the absorption phase and provides a precise and continuous mode of drug therapy, especially for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. To achieve the steady state quickly, the loading dose is used. Intravenously administered drug is diluted in the pooled venous blood and pumped through lungs before entering systematic circulation (lung first-pass effect). The target organ receives only the fraction of drug corresponding to the fraction of received arterial blood."
