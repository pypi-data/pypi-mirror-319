    "Mass spectrometry involving multiple mass-selection steps, with some form of fragmentation occurring between each stage. Sample ionisation is achieved by forcing a solution (usually in an organic solvent) of the sample through a small heated capillary (at a flow rate of 1\u201310 uL min-1) into an electric field to produce a very fine mist of positively charged droplets."
