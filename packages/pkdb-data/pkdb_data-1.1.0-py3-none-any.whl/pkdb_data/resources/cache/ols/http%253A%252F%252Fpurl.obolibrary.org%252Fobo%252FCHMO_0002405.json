    "The separation of molecules in solution by the difference in their rates of diffusion through a semipermeable membrane. In competition dialysis an array of nucleic acid structures and sequences is dialysed against a common test ligand solution. After equilibration, the amount of ligand bound to each structure or sequence is determined by absorbance or fluorescence measurements. Since all structures and sequences are in equilibrium with the same free ligand concentration, the amount bound is directly proportional to the ligand binding affinity."
