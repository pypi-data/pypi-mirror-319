      "A hexose with an aldehyde group; in which each of the 5 remaining carbons other than the aldehyde group has one hydroxyl group in the R,S,R, and R configuration counting from the first hydroxyl containing carbon next to the aldehyde in the straight chain (Fisher) projection; otherwise all carbons have exclusively hydrogens. Occurs mostly as pyran (6-membered oxygen containing ring or oxane) and rarely as furan (5-membered oxygen containing ring) or straight chain. When glucose forms a ring an additional \"\"anomeric\"\" asymmetric carbon is created which is denoted as \"\"alpha\"\" or \"\"beta\"\". For isomers see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose.",
