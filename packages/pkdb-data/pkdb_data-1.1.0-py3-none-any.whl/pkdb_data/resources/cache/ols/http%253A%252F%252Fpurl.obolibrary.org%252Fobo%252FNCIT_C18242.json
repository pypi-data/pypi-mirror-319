    "A process used for separating mixtures by virtue of differences in absorbency.  It involves stationary and mobile phases.  The stationary phase was packed in a column with materials that can be of any partitioning capability, adsorption, ion exchange, or affinity.  The mobile phase (either liquid or gas) is the mixture that required to be separated."
