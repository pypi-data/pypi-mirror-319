    "A method where the sample mixture is first separated by high-performance liquid chromatography before being ionised by forcing a solution (usually in an organic solvent) of it through a small heated capillary (at a flow rate of 1\u201310 uL min1) into an electric field to produce a very fine mist of charged droplets. The ions are then characterised according to mass-to-charge ratio and relative abundance by two mass spectrometers in series."
