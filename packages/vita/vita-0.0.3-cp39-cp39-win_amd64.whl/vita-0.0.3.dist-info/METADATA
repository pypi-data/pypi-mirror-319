# Vita

Vita is a Python module for interacting with the [Vital Synthesizer](https://github.com/mtytel/vital). **It is not an official product related to Vital**.

## Installation

Vita is supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Install with `pip`:

```bash
pip install vita
```

## Example

```python
from scipy.io import wavfile
import vita

SAMPLE_RATE = 44_100

bpm = 120.0
note_dur = 1.0
render_dur = 3.0
pitch = 36  # integer
velocity = 0.7  # [0.0 to 1.0]

synth = vita.Synth()
# The initial preset is loaded by default.

synth.set_bpm(bpm)

# Let's make a custom modulation using
# the available modulation sources and destinations.
# These lists are constant.
print("potential sources:", vita.get_modulation_sources())
print("potential destinations:", vita.get_modulation_destinations())

# "lfo_1" and "filter_1_cutoff" are potential sources and destinations.
assert synth.connect_modulation("lfo_1", "filter_1_cutoff")

controls = synth.get_controls()
controls["modulation_1_amount"].set(1.0)
controls["filter_1_on"].set(1.0)
controls["lfo_1_tempo"].set(vita.constants.SyncedFrequency.k1_16)

# Render audio to numpy array shaped (2, NUM_SAMPLES)
audio = synth.render(pitch, velocity, note_dur, render_dur)

wavfile.write("generated_preset.wav", SAMPLE_RATE, audio.T)

# Dump current state to JSON text
preset_path = "generated_preset.vital"

json_text = synth.to_json()
with open(preset_path, "w") as f:
    f.write(json_text)

# Load JSON text
with open(preset_path, "r") as f:
    json_text = f.read()
    assert synth.load_json(json_text)

# Or load directly from file
assert synth.load_preset(preset_path)

# Load the initial preset, which also clears modulations
synth.load_init_preset()
# Or just clear modulations.
synth.clear_modulations()
```

### Issues

If you find any issues with the code, report them at https://github.com/DBraun/Vita.

### Code Licensing
If you are making a proprietary or closed source app and would like to use Vital's source code, contact licensing@vital.audio for non GPLv3 licensing options.
