2. Click the "Split Purchase" button. The split wizard will be opened
3. Edit the values that the new purchase order will have.
4. Edit the lines the new purchase order will have. The most important is the quantity to split, but you can also edit the name, the order, or even delete some lines. You can edit the product price of the lines with the "Product Price Option" field of the above purchase order values
5. Click the "Accept" button. You will be redirected to the created purchase.
6. If the original purchase is still not completely splitted you should go back with the breadcrumbs or the "Original Purchase" smartbutton and continue splitting.
