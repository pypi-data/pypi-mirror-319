This module adds a wizard that allows you to split a purchase into multiple ones.

The splitting method has one particularity, when you split a purchase the original purchase quantities are not going to be edited, this is done to keep record of the original state of the purchase.

In counterpart, the original purchase will be archived and cancelled to not alter the forecasted stock. Users should split that original purchase the equivalent number of new split purchases you want to have.

For example, if you have a purchase of 10 product units and you want to split it into one purchase of 6 and another of 4, you have to split the original purchase into one of 6, go back to the original purchase and split it again into one of 4. As a result you will have 3 purchases, the purchase of 6, the purchase of 4, and the original purchase of 10 which will be archived and cancelled.
