This module adds a wizard that allows you to split a purchase into
multiple ones.

The splitting method has one particularity, when you split a purchase
the original purchase quantities are not going to be edited, this is
done to keep record of the original state of the purchase.

In counterpart, the original purchase will be archived and cancelled to
not alter the forecasted stock. Users should split that original
purchase the equivalent number of new split purchases you want to have.

For example, if you have a purchase of 10 product units and you want to
split it into one purchase of 6 and another of 4, you have to split the
original purchase into one of 6, go back to the original purchase and
split it again into one of 4. As a result you will have 3 purchases, the
purchase of 6, the purchase of 4, and the original purchase of 10 which
will be archived and cancelled.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to purchases and create a new purchase order in draft state with
   some purchase order lines.
2. Click the "Split Purchase" button. The split wizard will be opened
3. Edit the values that the new purchase order will have.
4. Edit the lines the new purchase order will have. The most important
   is the quantity to split, but you can also edit the name, the order,
   or even delete some lines. You can edit the product price of the
   lines with the "Product Price Option" field of the above purchase
   order values
5. Click the "Accept" button. You will be redirected to the created
   purchase.
6. If the original purchase is still not completely splitted you should
   go back with the breadcrumbs or the "Original Purchase" smartbutton
   and continue splitting.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Users should not let a split process of a purchase half done. Example:
  splitting a purchase of 10 units into a purchase of 3 units, 7 are
  pending. The expected future stock of that product won't count the 7
  pending units and the automatic reordering rules can generate new
  purchase orders.
