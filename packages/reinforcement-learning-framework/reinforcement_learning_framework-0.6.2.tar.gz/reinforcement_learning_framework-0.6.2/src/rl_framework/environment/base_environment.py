    Environment base class, from which every Environment should be inherited.

    It encapsulates an environment with arbitrary behind-the-scenes dynamics.

    This Environment provides the interface in the Gym format (actually it is even inherited from gym.Env).
    This is a standardized environment interface and should be used for every new environment created.

        This method can reset the environment's random number generator(s) if ``seed`` is an integer or
        if the environment has not yet initialized a random number generator.
        If the environment already has a random number generator and :meth:`reset` is called with ``seed=None``,
        the RNG should not be reset. Moreover, :meth:`reset` should (in the typical use case) be called with an
        integer seed right after initialization and then never again.

        Args:
            seed (optional int): The seed that is used to initialize the environment's PRNG.
                If the environment does not already have a PRNG and ``seed=None`` (the default option) is passed,
                a seed will be chosen from some source of entropy (e.g. timestamp or /dev/urandom).
                However, if the environment already has a PRNG and ``seed=None`` is passed, the PRNG will *not* be
                reset. If you pass an integer, the PRNG will be reset even if it already exists.
                Usually, you want to pass an integer *right after the environment has been initialized and then never
                again*. Please refer to the minimal example above to see this paradigm in action.
            return_info (bool): If true, return additional information along with initial observation.
                This info should be analogous to the info returned in :meth:`step`

                (typically a numpy array) and is analogous to the observation returned by :meth:`step`.
            info (optional dictionary): This will *only* be returned if ``return_info=True`` is passed.
                It contains auxiliary information complementing ``observation``. This dictionary should be analogous to
                the ``info`` returned by :meth:`step`.

          representing RGB values for an x-by-y pixel image, suitable
          for turning into a video.

        Note:
