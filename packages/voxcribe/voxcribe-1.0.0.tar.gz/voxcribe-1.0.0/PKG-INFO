# 🎙️ Voxcribe

Voxcribe is a Python package for transcribing audio files into text using speech recognition. It splits audio into manageable chunks, processes them in parallel, and combines the results into a single transcription.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔊 **Supports Multiple Formats**: Works with MP3, WAV, and other audio formats.
- ⚡ **Chunk-based Processing**: Splits large audio files into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
- 🖥️ **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes all available CPU cores for faster transcription.
- 📊 **Optional Progress Bar**: Displays a progress bar during processing, which can be disabled if needed.

---

## 📦 Installation

Install Voxcribe using pip:

```bash
pip install voxcribe
```

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (required by `pydub` for handling MP3 and other formats).
