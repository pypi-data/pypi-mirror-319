"""Obtain CSP sessions and credentials.

## Overview

This module provides a `SessionProvider` interface to obtain credentials for a
Cloud Service Provider (CSP). Regardless of the mechanism, the session provider
is responsible for returning a session that contains the credentials for a
requested account. Credentials constitute different structures based on the SDK
of the given CSP.

`awsrun.session.aws`
:  Credentials obtained from AWS are Boto3 session objects that can be used to
obtain Boto3 clients and resources.

`awsrun.session.azure`
:  Credentials obtained from Azure are the new-style azure.core that can be used
as arguments to the various Azure clients.
