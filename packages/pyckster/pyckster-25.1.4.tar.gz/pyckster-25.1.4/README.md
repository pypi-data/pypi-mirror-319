Pyckster is an open-source PyQt5-based GUI for picking seismic traveltimes. It reads seismic files in SEG2, SEGY and Seismic Unix (SU) formats. Picked traveltimes are saved in [pyGIMLi](https://www.pygimli.org)'s unified format so they can easily be inverted to reconstruct subsurface models of seismic velocity. 

## Installation

You can simply download the package from PyPi:
``` bash
pip install pyckster
```

Or download the sources file in the Gitlab repository and unzip it in the directory of your choice.

## Running Pyckster

If you installed Pyckster with Pypi, open a terminal and run:
```bash
pyckster
```

If you downloaded the source files, open a terminal, move to the `pyckster-master` directory and run:
```bash
python pyckster.py
```
