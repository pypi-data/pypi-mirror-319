**tn4ml** is a Python library that handles tensor networks for machine learning applications. It is built on top of **Quimb**, for Tensor Network objects, and **JAX**, for optimization pipeline.<br>
For now, the library supports 1D Tensor Network structures: **Matrix Product State**, **Matrix Product Operator** and **Spaced Matrix Product Operator**.<br>
It supports different **embedding** functions, **initialization** techniques, and **optimization strategies**.<br>

## Installation

First create a virtualenv using `pyenv` or `conda`. Then install the package and its dependencies.
<br>

**With** `pip` (tag v1.0.2):
```bash
pip install tn4ml
```
<br>

or **directly from github**:
```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/bsc-quantic/tn4ml.git
```
<br>

If you want to test and edit the code, you can clone local version of the package and install.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsc-quantic/tn4ml.git
pip install -e tn4ml/
```
