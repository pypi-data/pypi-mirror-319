A Graphviz error could arise. 
To solve the problem add the Graphviz executables on your systems' PATH as follows:

2. Install python graphviz package
3. Press the Windows key 
4. Type in the search box: edit environment variables for your account 
5. Select Path 
6. Click Editâ€¦ button  
7. Click New 
8. Add 'bin' folder to User path in environment variables manager (e.g: C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin)
9. Add location dot.exe to System Path (e.g: C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin\dot.exe)
10. Click OK and OK again 

Once have done that, restart your python IDE (if it is open). If this was running in a CMD prompt (e.g. 
Anaconda Command prompt), restart this prompt as well to make sure the prompt finds the new
environment variables.
