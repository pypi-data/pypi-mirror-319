           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

PyBreezeChMS
=================

Python interface to BreezeChMS REST API.

This is an adaption of [PyBreezeChMS](https://github.com/alexortizrosado/pyBreezeChMS),
the "official" Python implementation of the [Breeze API](https://app.breezechms.com/api).
However, the owner of said repository is apparently no longer with Breeze,
and doesn't respond to email or issues in that repository. This is distributed
as a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/breeze-chms-api/).

Since I've wanted several changes and enhancements, I've cloned that original
and extended it. However, what started as a minor cleanup, mostly with
the goal of making it a pip-installable package, it turned into 
quite a project. While vestiges of the original version remain, it's
a pretty major rewrite. Some things that motivated that:
* Upgrade to Python 3.6 or later; earlier versions are no longer supported.
* Using at least a current (maybe not latest) PEP coding standard.
* A number of method parameter names in the Python implementation differ
from the underlying implementation in the REST description. I found
that confusing, so parameter names in this implementation match the
REST description.
* I found a number of bugs in my testing.
* In my many years of coding, my credo has been "anything worth coding"
is worth coding once," so a great many repetitive instances of
similar code have been consolidated.

Consequentially, I'm calling this a new work, inspired by and including
a few internal pieces of the original.

And a note: I found that the original Python implementation doesn't
implement all the REST APIs. Volunteer management, for example, is
missing. I haven't added them. Maybe in a future release.

## Installation

    $ pip install breeze-chms-api

This will automatically install the required packages.

## Getting Started

The preferred method is to set up configuration files 
for [combine_settings](https://pypi.org/project/combine-settings/)
to specify the two parameters need to access the breeze_api:
* `breeze_url`: Your breeze access url.
* `api_key`: Your organization's API key.

Those settings must be in a file named `breeze_maker.yml`.

With those configuration files set up appropriately, you can instantiate
a `BreezeAPI` simply by:

```python
from breeze_chms_api import breeze

breeze_api = breeze.breeze_api()
```

`breeze.breeze_api()` also passes other keyword parameters through to `config_builder`
if needed. You can also override the default configuration file name with
the `config_name` parameter.

If you don't want to use `config_builder` you can pass `breeze_url` and `breeze_api`
directly to `breeze.breeze_api()`.


To get a JSON of all people:

```python
people = breeze_api.list_people()
```

## Other methods

* `get_account_summary`: Retrieve details of your account.
* `list_people`: Get information about people.
* `get_profile_fields`: Your organization's profile fields.
* `get_field_spec_by_id`: Get profile field specification by id
* `get_field_spec_by_name:` Get profile field specification for named field
* `get_person_details`: Details about a specific person from id.
* `add_person`: Add a person.
* `update_person`: Update a person's information.
* `list_calendars`: Get a list of calendars.
* `list_events`: Get a list of selected events.
* `list_event`: Get information about a specific event.
* `add_event`: Add an event
* `event_check_in`: Check someone in to an event.
* `event_check_out`: Remove someone from an event.
* `delete_attendance`: Delete attendance records for a person from an event.
* `list_eligible_people`: List people eligible for an event.
* `list_attendance`: List attendance for an event.
* `add_contribution`: Add a contribution.
* `edit_contribution`: Edit an existing contribution.
* `delete_contribution`: Delete a contribution.
* `list_form_entries`: Get submitted forms.
* `remove_form_entry`: Remove specified form entry.
* `list_form_fields`: List the fields in a given form.
* `list_contributions`: List selected contributions.
* `list_funds`: List your contribution funds.
* `list_campaigns`: List pledge campaigns.
* `list_pledges`: List pledges in a campaign.
* `get_tags`: Get information about your tags.
* `get_tag_folders`: And your tag folders.
* `assign_tag`: Assign a person to a tag.
* `unassign_tag` and unassign them.

The parameters and returns of all of the above are described in the 
[Breeze API Reference Guide](https://app.breezechms.com/api). Look there,
or the source of this package as necessary.

For deails of this Python implementation see 
[this documentation](https://github.com/dawillcox/pyBreezeChMS/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Test
    pip install coverage combine-settings
    coverage run -m unittest
    coverage report -m

## How do I make a contribution?
Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in the in our project? Here's a quick rundown!

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
2. Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under `your-GitHub-username/pyBreezeChMS`.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/github-username/pyBreezeChMS.git.
4. Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.
5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
6. Use `git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here` to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
7. Use `git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here"` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
8. Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin branch-name-here`.
9. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
10. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".
11. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
12. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer.
13. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.
14. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!
