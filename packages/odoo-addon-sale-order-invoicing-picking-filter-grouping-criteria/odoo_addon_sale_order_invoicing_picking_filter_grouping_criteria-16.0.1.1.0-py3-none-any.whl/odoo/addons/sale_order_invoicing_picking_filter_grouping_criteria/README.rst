This module extends the functionality of
sale_order_invoicing_grouping_criteria and
sale_order_invoicing_picking_filter, to support both the functionality
of selecting the pickings that will be invoiced, and grouping the
generated invoices, when invoicing multiple sales at the same time.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to follow the instructions of the
sale_order_invoicing_picking_filter and
sale_order_invoicing_grouping_criteria modules.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to Sales / To Invoice / Orders to Invoice
2. Select sales orders whose invoicing you want to do.
3. Click on *Action > Create invoices*.
4. Select the pickings whose invoicing you want to do.
5. Click on "Create and View Invoices" button.
6. On that moment, the grouping criteria will be applied, and you will
   see different invoices if the criteria doesn't match for the sales.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module dependencies provides 2 different ways of grouping the sale
invoices:

- The Odoo's, developed in the sale module.
- The OCA's, developed in the sale_order_invoicing_grouping_criteria.

This module glues the OCA's function with the
sale_order_invoicing_picking_filter. The Odoo function works perfectly
with the sale_order_invoicing_picking_filter alone.

If a module that edits the Odoo's grouping function is installed it
could be incompatible with the OCA grouping function.
