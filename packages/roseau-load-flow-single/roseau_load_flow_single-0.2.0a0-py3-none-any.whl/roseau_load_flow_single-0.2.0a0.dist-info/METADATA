# Roseau Load Flow Single

_Roseau Load Flow Single_ is a _single-phase_ version of the load flow solver
[Roseau_Load_Flow](https://github.com/RoseauTechnologies/Roseau_Load_Flow/).
It comes with a simpler interface for power flow analysis of balanced three-phase power systems
using their equivalent single-phase model.

Note that this solver is still in **alpha** development, and is likely to change a lot.
