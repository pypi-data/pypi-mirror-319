Abstract: Modern Out-of-Order (OoO) CPUs are complex systems with many components interleaved in non-trivial ways. Pinpointing performance bottlenecks and understanding the underlying causes of program performance issues are critical tasks to fully exploit the performance offered by hardware resources.
  Current performance debugging approaches rely either on measuring resource utilization, in order to estimate which parts of a CPU induce performance limitations, or on code-based analysis deriving bottleneck information from capacity/throughput models. These approaches are limited by instrumental and methodological precision, present portability constraints across different microarchitectures, and often offer factual information about resource constraints, but not causal hints about how to solve them.
  This paper presents a novel performance debugging and analysis tool that implements a resource-centric CPU model driven by dynamic binary instrumentation that is capable of detecting complex bottlenecks caused by an interplay of hardware and software factors. Bottlenecks are detected through sensitivity-based analysis, a sort of model parameterization that uses differential analysis to reveal constrained resources. It also implements a new technique we developed that we call causality analysis, that propagates constraints to pinpoint how each instruction contribute to the overall execution time.
  To evaluate our analysis tool, we considered the set of high-performance computing kernels obtained by applying a wide range of transformations from the Polybench benchmark suite and measured the precision on a few Intel CPU and Arm micro-architectures. We also took one of the benchmarks (correlation) as an illustrative example to illustrate how our tool's bottleneck analysis can be used to optimize a code.

## Design choices made by LLM-based test generators prevent them from finding bugs

**Abstract:** arXiv:2412.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an increasing amount of research and commercial tools for automated test case generation using Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper critically examines whether recent LLM-based test generation tools, such as Codium CoverAgent and CoverUp, can effectively find bugs or unintentionally validate faulty code. Considering bugs are only exposed by failing test cases, we explore the question: can these tools truly achieve the intended objectives of software testing when their test oracles are designed to pass? Using real human-written buggy code as input, we evaluate these tools, showing how LLM-generated tests can fail to detect bugs and, more alarmingly, how their design can worsen the situation by validating bugs in the generated test suite and rejecting bug-revealing tests. These findings raise important questions about the validity of the design behind LLM-based test generation tools and their impact on software quality and test suite reliability.

**PDF Summary:** Your document provides an insightful analysis of automated test generation using large language models (LLMs) and highlights several key challenges and future directions. Here's a summary to help contextualize the main points:

### Key Points from the Document:
1. **Test Generation Challenges**: 
   - LLMs, while powerful, face the "oracle problem" in software testing, where determining expected outputs is inherently difficult.
   - Generated tests often lack coverage due to various biases and inadequacies of input data.

2. **Specific Weaknesses**:
   - Tests often have fixed input values leading to insufficient code coverage.
   - Output discrepancies arise from ambiguous test definitions or incorrect assumptions about output expectations.

3. **Coverage Approaches**:
   - The document discusses the exploration of branch, line, and statement coverages as strategies for improving test generation.
   - Various algorithms (e.g., Dijkstraâ€™s, Breadth-First Search) are employed to enhance coverage metrics which measure how thoroughly tests explore a program's code paths.

4. **Summaries and Observations**:
   - While LLM-based testing provides significant potential benefits such as code coverage improvements and automated test case generation, the effectiveness depends heavily on underlying data quality and training methodology.
   - There is optimism about future iterations of these models, particularly with better datasets leading to more accurate performance.

5. **Future Directions**:
   - Emphasis on increasing test suite diversity through multiple seeds or randomizations can improve test generation outcomes.
   - Further refinements in LLMs are expected to enhance their utility for unit and integration testing tasks.

6. **Conclusions Regarding Current Models**:
   - The performance of current models reveals mixed results across different programming languages, with particular strengths identified such as in Python and Java.
   - Limitations noted pertain primarily to the insufficient coverage on code segments needing more thorough testing.

7. **Limitations and Recommendations**:
   - Potential biases or errors stemming from model training pose a risk of propagating incorrect assumptions into the test outputs.
   - Future work should focus on reducing these biases, possibly by refining language models through diverse datasets that better reflect real-world programming scenarios.

### Insights for Further Research:
- Enhanced data preprocessing could play a critical role in diminishing noise and improving the accuracy of generated tests from LLMs.
- There's potential for hybrid approaches that combine different coverage metrics (e.g., branch and path testing) in conjunction with LLM-generated outputs to strike a balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency.

These insights form an integral foundation upon which further enhancements and empirical investigations can be developed. This will contribute towards more robust automated software testing protocols leveraging the capabilities of next-generation AI models.
