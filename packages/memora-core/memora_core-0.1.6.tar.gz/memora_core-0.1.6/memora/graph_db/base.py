            >>> batch_memories = graphInstance.fetch_memories_resolved_batch(batch_org_user_mem_ids)
            >>> print([[memoryObj['memory'] for memoryObj in memories] for memories in batch_memories])
            [["John asked for help with a wedding ring", "Sarah is allergic to peanuts"], ["John is about to propose to Sarah"]]
            ```
