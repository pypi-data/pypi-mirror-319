               and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
               Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
               excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
               designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
         
               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

Omnipy is a high level Python library for type-driven data wrangling and scalable workflow
orchestration.

![Conceptual overview of Omnipy](https://fairtracks.net/materials/images/omnipy-overview.png)

## Updates

- **June 22, 2024:** We're not very good at writing updates. Expect a larger update soon on an important 
  and potentially groundbreaking new feature of Omnipy: the capability of model objects to automatically 
  mimic behaviour of the modelled class – with the addition of snapshots and rollbacks.
  So e.g. `Model[list[int]]()` is not just a run-time typesafe parser that continuously makes sure that the 
  elements in the list are, in fact, integers; the object can also be operated as a list using e.g. 
  `.append()`, `.insert()` and concatenation with the `+` operator; and furthermore: if you append an
  unparseable element, say `"abc"` instead of `"123"`, it will roll back the contents to the previously 
  validated snapshot!
- **Feb 3, 2023:** Documentation of the Omnipy API is still sparse. However, for examples of running
  code, please check out the [omnipy-examples repo](https://github.com/fairtracks/omnipy_examples).
- **Dec 22, 2022:** Omnipy is the new name of the Python package formerly known as uniFAIR.
  _We are very grateful to Dr. Jamin Chen, who gracefully transferred ownership of the (mostly 
  unused) "omnipy" name in PyPI to us!__

## Generic functionality

_(NOTE: Read the
section [Transformation on the FAIRtracks.net website](https://fairtracks.net/fair/#fair-07-transformation)
for a more detailed and better formatted version of the following description!)_

Omnipy is designed primarily to simplify development and deployment of (meta)data transformation
processes in the context of FAIRification and data brokering efforts. However, the functionality is
very generic and can also be used to support research data (and metadata) transformations in a range
of fields and contexts beyond life science, including day-to-day research scenarios:

## Data wrangling in day-to-day research

Researchers in life science and other data-centric fields
often need to extract, manipulate and integrate data and/or metadata from different sources, such as
repositories, databases or flat files. Much research time is spent on trivial and not-so-trivial
details of such ["data wrangling"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling):

- reformat data structures
- clean up errors
- remove duplicate data
- map and integrate dataset fields
- etc.

General software for data wrangling and analysis, such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [Frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/), are useful, but
researchers still regularly end up with hard-to-reuse scripts, often with manual steps.

## Step-wise data model transformations

With the Omnipy Python package, researchers can import (meta)data in almost any shape or form:
_nested JSON; tabular
(relational) data; binary streams; or other data structures_. Through a step-by-step process, data
is continuously parsed and reshaped according to a series of data model transformations.

## "Parse, don't validate"

Omnipy follows the principles of "Type-driven design" (read
_Technical note #2: "Parse, don't validate"_ on the
[FAIRtracks.net website](https://fairtracks.net/fair/#fair-07-transformation) for more info). It
makes use of cutting-edge [Python type hints](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) and the popular
[pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) package to "pour" data into precisely defined data
models that can range from very general (e.g. _"any kind of JSON data", "any kind of tabular data"_,
etc.) to very specific (e.g. _"follow the FAIRtracks JSON Schema for track files with the extra
restriction of only allowing BigBED files"_).

## Data types as contracts

Omnipy _tasks_ (single steps) or _flows_ (workflows) are defined as
transformations from specific _input_ data models to specific _output_ data models.
[pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)-based parsing guarantees that the input and output
data always follows the data models (i.e. data types). Thus, the data models defines "contracts"
that simplifies reuse of tasks and flows in a _mix-and-match_ fashion.

## Catalog of common processing steps

Omnipy is built from the ground up to be modular. We aim
to provide a catalog of commonly useful functionality ranging from:

- data import from REST API endpoints, common flat file formats, database dumps, etc.
- flattening of complex, nested JSON structures
- standardization of relational tabular data (i.e. removing redundancy)
- mapping of tabular data between schemas
- lookup and mapping of ontology terms
- semi-automatic data cleaning (through e.g. [Open Refine](https://openrefine.org/))
- support for common data manipulation software and libraries, such as
  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/),
  [Frictionless](https://frictionlessdata.io/), etc.

In particular, we will provide a _FAIRtracks_ module that contains data models and processing steps
to transform metadata to follow the [FAIRtracks standard](/standards/#standards-01-fairtracks).

![Catalog of commonly useful processing steps, data modules and tool integrations](https://fairtracks.net/_nuxt/img/7101c5f-1280.png)

## Refine and apply templates

An Omnipy module typically consists of a set of generic _task_ and
_flow templates_ with related data models, (de)serializers, and utility functions. The user can then
pick task and flow templates from this extensible, modular catalog, further refine them in the
context of a custom, use case-specific flow, and apply them to the desired compute engine to carry
out the transformations needed to wrangle data into the required shape.

## Rerun only when needed

When piecing together a custom flow in Omnipy, the user has persistent
access to the state of the data at every step of the process. Persistent intermediate data allows
for caching of tasks based on the input data and parameters. Hence, if the input data and parameters
of a task does not change between runs, the task is not rerun. This is particularly useful for
importing from REST API endpoints, as a flow can be continuously rerun without taxing the remote
server; data import will only carried out in the initial iteration or when the REST API signals that
the data has changed.

## Scale up with external compute resources

In the case of large datasets, the researcher can set
up a flow based on a representative sample of the full dataset, in a size that is suited for running
locally on, say, a laptop. Once the flow has produced the correct output on the sample data, the
operation can be seamlessly scaled up to the full dataset and sent off in
[software containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) to run on external compute
resources, using e.g. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Such offloaded flows
can be easily monitored using a web GUI.

![Working with Omnipy directly from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://fairtracks.net/_nuxt/img/f9be071-1440.png)

## Industry-standard ETL backbone

Offloading of flows to external compute resources is provided by
the integration of Omnipy with a workflow engine based on the [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/)
Python package. Prefect is an industry-leading platform for dataflow automation and orchestration
that brings a [series of powerful features](https://www.prefect.io/opensource/) to Omnipy:

- Predefined integrations with a range of compute infrastructure solutions
- Predefined integration with various services to support extraction, transformation, and loading
  (ETL) of data and metadata
- Code as workflow ("If Python can write it, Prefect can run it")
- Dynamic workflows: no predefined Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) needed!
- Command line and web GUI-based visibility and control of jobs
- Trigger jobs from external events such as GitHub commits, file uploads, etc.
- Define continuously running workflows that still respond to external events
- Run tasks concurrently through support for asynchronous tasks

![Overview of the compute and storage infrastructure integrations that comes built-in with Prefect](https://fairtracks.net/_nuxt/img/ccc322a-1440.png)

## Pluggable workflow engines

It is also possible to integrate Omnipy with other workflow
backends by implementing new workflow engine plugins. This is relatively easy to do, as the core
architecture of Omnipy allows the user to easily switch the workflow engine at runtime. Omnipy
supports both traditional DAG-based and the more _avant garde_ code-based definition of flows. Two
workflow engines are currently supported: _local_ and _prefect_.
