                <h4>Completeness Commission</h4> Excess data in the dataset, as described by the scope. For example, the Atlas of NSW Wildlife contains some records for Victoria and Queensland.
                <h4>Conceptual Consistency</h4> Adherence to the conceptual schema rules. Inconsistencies could include for example, invalid placement of features within a defined tolerance, duplication of features or invalid overlap of features.
                <h4>Completeness Omission</h4> Data absent from the dataset, as described by the scope.
                <h4>Absolute external positional accuracy</h4> Accuracy of the position features i.e. closeness of reported coordinate values to values accepted as being true.
                <h4>Topological consistency</h4> Correctness of the explicitly encoded topological characteristics of the dataset, as described by the scope.
                <h4>Non quantitative attribute accuracy</h4> Attribute correctness.
