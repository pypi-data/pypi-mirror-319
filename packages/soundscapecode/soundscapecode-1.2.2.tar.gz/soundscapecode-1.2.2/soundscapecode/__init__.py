'''Python implemention of the soundscapecode, for analysing ecoacoustic soundscapes.

See the `paper`_.
This implementation is ported from a Matlab `example`_.

Functions
----------
max_spl:
    calculates the maximum sound pressure level for a sound
rms_spl:
    calculates the root mean square sound pressure level for a sound
periodicity:
    calculates the periodicity for a sound
kurtosis:
    calculates the kurtosis for a sound
temporal_dissimilarity:
    calculates the temporal dissimilarity between two sound segments
stft_psd:
    calculates the power spectral density for a recording
meanfreq:
    gets the mean frequency per 0.1s segment in a recording, for a given frequency range
spectral_dissimilarity:
    calculates the spectral dissimilarity between two sound segments
dissimilarity index:
    calculates the dissimilarity index between two sound segments


Classes
-------
SoundscapeCode: wrapper for calculating all metrics for all one-minute segments in a longer recording

Modules
-------
soundtrap: utilities for working with soundtraos
filters: highpass and bandpass filters
