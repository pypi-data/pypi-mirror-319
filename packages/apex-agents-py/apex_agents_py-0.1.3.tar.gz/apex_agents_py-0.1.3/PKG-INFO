First install the package via PyPi.
```bash
pip install Apex-agents-py
```
Then define your agent, give it the tools it needs and run it!
```py
from Apex import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel

agent = CodeAgent(tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()], model=HfApiModel())

agent.run("Tell me Solana and Bitcoin price in March 2025")

## How strong are open models for agentic workflows?

We've created `CodeAgent` instances with some leading models, and compared them on [this benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-ric/agents_medium_benchmark_2) that gathers questions from a few different benchmarks to propose a varied blend of challenges.
