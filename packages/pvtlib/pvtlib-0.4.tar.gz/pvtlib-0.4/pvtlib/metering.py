    '''
    Calculate mass flowrate and volume flowrate of a V-cone meter. 
    Calculations performed according to NS-EN ISO 5167-5:2022. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    D : float
        The diameter of the pipe at the beta edge, D.  [m]
        Assumes that the diameter of the pipe at the upstream tapping, DTAP, is equal to the diameter of the pipe at the beta edge, D. 
        In easier terms, its the inlet diameter.
    beta : float
        V-cone beta.
    dP : float
        Differential pressure [mbar].
    rho1 : float
        Density at the upstream tapping [kg/m3].
    C : float, optional
        Discharge coefficient. 
        If no value of C is provided, the function uses the value of 0.82 given in NS-EN ISO 5167-5:2022.
        Under the following conditions, the value of the discharge coefficient, C, for an uncalibrated meter is C=0.82
            - 50 mm ≤ D ≤ 500 mm
            - 0,45 ≤ β ≤ 0,75
            - 8 × 104 ≤ ReD ≤ 1,2 × 107
    epsilon : float, optional
        expansibility factor (ε) is a coefficient used to take into account the compressibility of the fluid. 
        If no expansibility is provided, the function will use 1.0. 

    Returns
