"""
This module handles all equipment that has to be added to the
'Weapons and Equipment' section of the record sheet by storing
it in a dedicated 'equipment' section in the JSON data.

Because that kind of equipment is scattered across the various
critical slot entries in the MTF files (with different equipment
having different format, e. g. some contain a ':SIZE:' value),
it is added after the JSON conversion, in a separate step.

Another issue is that some MTF files contain some equipment in the
'Weapons' sections while others don't. This module is responsible
for cleaning that mess up a bit.
