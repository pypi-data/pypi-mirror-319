    """
    Perform a doubly constrained furness for max_iters or until tol is met.

    Controls numpy warnings to warn of any overflow errors encountered

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed_vals:
        Initial values for the furness. Must be of shape
        (len(n_rows), len(n_cols)).

    row_targets:
        The target values for the sum of each row.
        i.e np.sum(matrix, axis=1)

    col_targets:
        The target values for the sum of each column
        i.e np.sum(matrix, axis=0)

    tol:
        The maximum difference between the achieved and the target values
        to tolerate before exiting early. R^2 is used to calculate the
        difference.

    max_iters:
        The maximum number of iterations to complete before exiting.

    warning:
        Whether to print a warning or not when the tol cannot be met before
        max_iters.

    Returns
    -------
    furnessed_matrix:
        The final furnessed matrix

    completed_iters:
        The number of completed iterations before exiting

    achieved_rmse:
        The Root Mean Squared Error difference achieved before exiting
