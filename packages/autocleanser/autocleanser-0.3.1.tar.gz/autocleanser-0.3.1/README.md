Data Cleansing Tool
This project provides a Python script for cleansing data in various file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML). It offers a variety of operations to clean and process your data, including removing null values, handling duplicates, formatting column names, and transforming date columns. Users can choose cleansing operations interactively through a command-line interface.

Features
File Format Support: CSV, Excel (.xls, .xlsx), JSON, XML,
if you chose any operation,then want to getback to origianl data option also included.
Operations:
Remove rows/columns with null values.
Replace null values with a custom value.
Remove duplicate rows and columns.
Convert column names to lowercase and remove whitespaces.
Split date columns into day, month, and year.
Convert categorical columns to One-Hot Encoding.
And many more customizable data cleansing options....
Installation
Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.

Dependencies: Ensure that you have Python 3.x. You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
Usage

Run the script: In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the script is located and run it:

bash
Copy code
python autocleaner.py or python3 autocleaner.py
Enter file path: You will be prompted to enter the file path of the dataset you want to clean.

Choose cleansing operations: The script will display a menu of available operations. Enter the numbers of the operations you want to apply (separate multiple choices with commas). Some of the available operations include:

Remove rows/columns with null values.
Replace null values with a custom value.
Remove duplicate rows and columns.
Convert column names to lowercase and remove whitespaces.
Split date columns into day, month, and year.
Convert categorical columns to One-Hot Encoding.
Remove rows with null values.
Replace null values with a specified value.
Convert column names to lowercase.
Convert a date column to 'day', 'month', and 'year'.
Exit or revert to original: Type 'backtodata' to revert to the original data or 'exit' to stop the program.

Output: After performing the selected operations, the final cleaned DataFrame will be displayed.

Example
Hereâ€™s a simple usage example:

bash
Copy code
Enter your file path: data.csv
Choose cleansing operations (multiple choices allowed):
 Remove rows with null values
 Remove columns with null values
 Replace null values with a specified value
 Remove duplicate rows
 Convert column names to lowercase
...
Enter the numbers of the operations you'd like to perform, separated by commas: 1,4,5
Final DataFrame:
  Column1  Column2
0       1       10
1       2       20
