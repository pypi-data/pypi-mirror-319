# pandas-emetrics
`pandas-emetrics` is a Python package integrating ethical data algorithms and metrics directly into [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) DataFrame processing. `pandas-emetrics` provides the necessary tools for users to analyze and increase the level of privacy and anonymity in their datasets. Through techniques such as k-anonymity, differential privacy, and feature suppression, consumers and research participants can feel confident that their data is being handled in a secure, ethical manner.

Through `pandas-emetrics`, I aim to bring data ethics, a field far too often considered an afterthought, to the forefront of development for data scientists, analysts, researchers, teachersâ€”virtually anyone working with potentially sensitive personal information. By allowing these techniques to be easily understandable and accessible, I hope that more people begin to realize the importance of data ethics.
