# flukit

This is a package to deal with the sequence stuffs of influenza virus.

For example, to align the amino acid sequences of influenza virus, and denote the sequences by canonical H3 numbering. This will need the command line software "probcons" to help.

To mutate the sequences in batch, for example if user input "H3:Y98F", the program will mutate the residue from Y to F at position 98 according to the H3 numbering.
