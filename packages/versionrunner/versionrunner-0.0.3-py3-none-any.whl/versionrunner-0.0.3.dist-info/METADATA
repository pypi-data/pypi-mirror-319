# versionrunner
## Motivation

After writing a program, it is essential to generate a `requirements.txt` file before distribution, so that other users can easily recreate the deployed program.

However, finding and specifying the versions manually can often be tedious. In such cases, you can use `versionrunner` to quickly convert the library versions into a requirements.txt file and save it automatically.

```
