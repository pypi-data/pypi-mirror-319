YMSCRIPT: PYTHON+NUMPY REIMPLEMENTATION OF SOME IMSCRIPT FUNCTIONS
==================================================================

Just some handy functions from imscript implemented in python+numpy,
with similar semantics.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Install with "pip install ymscript"

- qauto : quantize an image to 8 bits
- sauto : quantize and apply a signed palette
- vauto : quantize a vector field to rgb
- lap,grad,div : differential operators
- ntiply : enlarge pixels by an integer factor
- blur : blur by various kernels (gauss,cauchy,laplace,riesz,disk,square)
- laplace : smooth interpolation
- poisson : poisson editing

There are no explicit requirements, but most functions require numpy or some
numpy-mocking arrays.  The requirements are "soft".  The package will install
correctly no matter what, but some functions will fail at runtime if their
requirements are not satisfied.

The differential operators require imgra.

The blur requires numpy.fft

Poisson editing requires imgra and scipy.linalg


RELEASING
