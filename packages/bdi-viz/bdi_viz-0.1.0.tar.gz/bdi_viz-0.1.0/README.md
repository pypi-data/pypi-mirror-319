## Introduction

BDIViz is a powerful, interactive tool designed as an extension to [BDIKit](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/bdi-kit) to assist biomedical researchers and domain experts in performing schema matching tasks. Built to address the challenges of matching complex biomedical datasets, BDIViz leverages a visual approach to streamline the process and enhance both speed and accuracy.

Key features of BDIViz include:

- **Interactive Heatmap** for exploring and comparing matching candidates.
- **Value Comparisons** Panel for analyzing similarities between attributes.
- **Detailed Analysis** Panel offering in-depth insights into attribute value distributions.
- **Filtering & Refinement Tools** to customize and adjust matching candidates based on datatype and similarity scores.
- **Expert-in-the-Loop Workflow** allowing users to iteratively accept, reject, or refine matches, keeping the expert in control of decision-making.

BDIViz is designed to be integrated with Python notebooks, providing a flexible and easy-to-use tool for domain-specific schema matching in biomedical research and beyond.
