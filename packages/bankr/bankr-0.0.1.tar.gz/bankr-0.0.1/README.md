*Bankr is simple Python code for your Bank Accounting, incl. a categorization of your incomes and expenses*

---

***Alpha** Software*

This software is in **Alpha** state. There are a several TODOs in the source code, and a few more ideas in my head for completion of its functionality! However, `v1` of the data format should be stable right now.

---


## Motivation

My motivation for writing these lines of Python code are two-fold:

1. Learning *Python*, *Pandas*, and - currently very basic in this Python project - *Panel*.
2. Starting with CSV based accounting, especially after some negative experiences with trying to use an [HBCI (now FinTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FinTS) based accounting system. Banks tend to break their own HBCI accesses, especially since their most important accesses nowadays seem to be their own and individual banking apps. Fortunately, I am not aware of a bank, which does not allow a CSV based download of the respective transaction data.
