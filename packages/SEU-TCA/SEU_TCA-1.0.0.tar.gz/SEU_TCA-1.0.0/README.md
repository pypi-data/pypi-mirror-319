# SEU-TCA

SEU-TCA (Spatial Expression Utility - Transfer Component Analysis) is a computational framework for integrating spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) data with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.

## Features
- Implements Transfer Component Analysis (TCA) with flexible kernel functions (`primal`, `linear`, `rbf`).
- Suitable for mapping and aligning spatial and single-cell transcriptomics datasets.
- Includes hyperparameter optimization and evaluation functions.

## Installation
To install the package, clone the repository and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LinluoLab/SEU-TCA.git
cd SEU-TCA
pip install .
