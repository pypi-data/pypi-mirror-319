# epidemic-intelligence
`epidemic-intelligence` is an open-source Python package developed at the Network Science Institute to explore large-scale spatio-temporal simulation data. Simply put, it uses Google's BigQuery to efficiently process and visualize simulations of networks across time, then uses the output to create publication ready visualizations. 

This GitHub repository contains the code for the Python package and the documentation, which is contained within a JupyterBook.  

## Tools
Full documentation, including installation and setup, is available [here](https://www.matteochinazzi.com/epidemic-intelligence/content/setup.html). 

The `epidemic-intelligence` package  can be found on the Python Package Index [here](https://pypi.org/project/epidemic-intelligence). 

Instructions for updating both the library and the corresponding documentation can be found in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
