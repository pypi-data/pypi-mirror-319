CUDA Waveform Tests with hypothesis
-----------------------------------

This test suite contains tests to ensure that the output of CUDA-based waveform models
both complies with the API and also behave as expected with various inputs.

These tests do not attempt to test the scientific accuracy of the waveforms.
