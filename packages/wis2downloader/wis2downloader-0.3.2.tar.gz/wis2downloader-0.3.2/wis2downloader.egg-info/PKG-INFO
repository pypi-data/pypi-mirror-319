              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

</div>

The WIS2 Downloader is a Flask-based Python application that allows you to connect to a WIS2 Global Broker, manage subscriptions to topic hierarchies, and configure their associated download directories.

## Features

- **Dynamic Subscription Management**: Quickly add or remove subscriptions ad hoc without needing to restart the service or change configuration files.
- **Monitor Download Statistics**: Access the Prometheus metrics through the `/metrics` endpoint, ideal for <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/">Grafana visualization</a>.
- **Multi-Threading Support**: Configure the number of download workers for more efficient data downloading.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
python -m pip install wis2downloader
```

```

An example is given below:

```json
{
    "base_url": "http://localhost:5050",
    "broker_hostname": "globalbroker.meteo.fr",
    "broker_password": "everyone",
    "broker_port": 443,
    "broker_protocol": "websockets",
    "broker_username": "everyone",
    "download_workers": 1,
    "download_dir": "downloads",
    "flask_host": "0.0.0.0",
    "flask_port": 5050,
    "log_level": "DEBUG",
    "log_path": "logs",
    "min_free_space": 10,
    "mqtt_session_info" : "mqtt_session.json",
    "save_logs": false,
    "validate_topics": true
}
```

### 3. Running

1. Set an environment variable specifying the path to the config.json file.

*Linux (bash)*
```bash
export WIS2DOWNLOADER_CONFIG=<path_to_your_config_file>
```

*Windows (Command Prompt)*
```shell
set WIS2DOWNLOADER_CONFIG=<path_to_your_config_file>
```

*Windows (PowersShell)*
```shell
$env:WIS2DOWNLOADER_CONFIG = <path_to_your_config_file>
```

2. Start the downloader

*Dev mode (Windows and Linux)*

```bash
wis2downloader
```

*Using gunicorn (Linux only)*
```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5050 -w 1 wis2downloader.app:app
```

**Note**: Only one worker is supported due to the downloader spawning additional threads and persistence of MQTT
connections.

The Flask application should now be running. If you need to stop the application,
 you can do so in the terminal with `Ctrl+C`.

## Maintaining and Monitoring Subscriptions

The API defintion of the downloader can be found at the `/swagger` endpoint, when run locally see
[http://localhost:5050/swagger]. this includes the ability to try out the different endpoints.

### Adding subscriptions
Subscriptions can be added via a POST request to the `/subscriptions` endpoint.
The request body should be JSON-encoded and adhere to the following schema:

```yaml
schema:
  type: object
  properties:
    topic:
      type: string
      description: The WIS2 topic to subscribe to
      example: cache/a/wis2/+/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/#
    target:
      type: string
      description: Sub directory to save data to
      example: surface-obs
  required:
    - topic
```

In this example all notifications published to the `surface-based-observations` topic from any WIS2 centre will be
 subscribed to, with the downloaded data written to the `surface-obs` subdirectory of the `download_dir`.

Notes:
1. If the `target` is not specified it will default to the topic the data are published on.
1. The `+` wildcard is used to specify any match at a single level, matching as WIS2 centre in the above example.
1. The `#` wildcard matches any topic at or below the level it occurs. In the above example any topic published below
 cache/a/wis2/+/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations will be matched.

#### Example CURL command to add subscription

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:5050/subscriptions' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
      "topic": "cache/a/wis2/+/data/core/weather/surface-based-observations/#",
      "target": "surface-obs"
  }'
```

### Deleting subscriptions
Subscriptions are deleted via a DELETE request to the `/subscriptions/{topic}` endpoint where `{topic}` is the topic
 to unsubscribe from.

#### Example CURL command to delete subscription

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5050/subscriptions/cache/a/wis2/%2B/data/core/weather/%23
```

This cancels the `cache/a/wis2/+/data/core/weather/#` subscription. Note the need to URL encode the `+` (`%2B`)
 and `#` (`%23`) symbols.

### Listing subscriptions
Current subscriptions can listed via a GET request to `/subscriptions` endpoint.

#### Example CURL command to list subscriptions

```bash
curl http://localhost:5050/subscriptions
```

The list of active subscriptions should be returned as a JSON object.

### Viewing download metrics
Prometheus metrics for the downloader are found via a GET request to the `/metrics` endpoint.

#### Example CURL command to view download metrics

```bash
curl http://localhost:5050/metrics
```
