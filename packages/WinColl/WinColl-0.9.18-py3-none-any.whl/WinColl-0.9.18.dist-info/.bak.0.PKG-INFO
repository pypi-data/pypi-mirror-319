# WinColl

https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll  

by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>  

WinColl is a simple puzzle game in which you tunnel through caverns
collecting diamonds while avoiding being squashed by falling rocks. It is
based on [Repton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repton_(video_game)) (but
without eggs and monsters).

I originally wrote WinColl for Acorn RISC OS. Original and updated [RISC OS
versions](<https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll/RISC OS.md>) are available.

The name of the game is an abbreviation of my school’s. “Repton” is also the
name of a school, but I don’t believe the game was named after it!


## Credits

Level design and graphics also by Alistair Turnbull, Paul Smith and Jeremy
Douglas. Paul also designed the title graphic.

The sounds are from [Freesound](https://freesound.org), lightly adapted.


## Installation and use
 
The game provides instructions on how to play.

### Binary installers

Installers are available for GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows. See the
[latest release](https://github.com/wincoll/releases):

* The GNU/Linux version is a single binary; you need to make it executable
  and then either copy it to a directory on your path, or run it directly:
  `chmod +x NAME-OF-FILE; ./NAME-OF-FILE`
* The macOS version is a disk image file containing an application. Drag the
  application to a suitable location (e.g. your Applications folder). macOS
  will probably refuse to run it until you have approved it in System
  Settings→Privacy and Security, under “Security”.
* The Windows version is a single `.exe`. Unfortunately it is detected as a
  virus by most virus scanners, including Microsoft Defender, because Python
  apps have often been used to distribute malware. Hence, you will probably
  have to turn off virus scanning before you download it (to prevent it from
  being immediately quarantined or deleted), and then add an exception for
  it. After that, you can put the `.exe` file in a suitable location and
  double-click it to play.

### Python package

If you are a Python user, this is the simplest way to get WinColl on most
machines.

Install with `pip`: `pip install wincoll`, then execute the command
`wincoll`.


## Creating and editing levels

Currently, to play edited or new levels you must have a source check-out of
WinColl from GitHub. (If this doesn’t make sense to you, sorry! I hope to
provide a simpler way to edit and play new levels soon.)

The level files are in the `wincoll/levels` subdirectory of the project, and
are [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) level editor files, so you will need
to install Tiled to edit them.

Having saved an edited level you can install the Python package with
`pip install .` or run it directly with `PYTHONPATH=. python -m wincoll`.

Some notes about level design:

+ The supplied levels have a brick wall all the way around. This is
  conventional but not necessary: there’s an imaginary brick wall around the
  outside of the level already.
+ Levels need exactly one start position (represented by placing the Win
  character).
+ No other checks are done to make sure a level is possible to complete; for
  example, you can place diamonds surrounded by bricks, or have safes but no
  key.

The files are named `Level??.tmx` where the question marks represent two
decimal digits.

I welcome [pull requests](https://github.com/rrthomas/wincoll/pulls) for new
levels.
