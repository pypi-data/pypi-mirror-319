"""Import modules on demand.

Lazy importing is a detail best kept to library writers. Application writers
should not need to use lazy imports at all. Callees are in a much better
position to know whether it is safe to delay or reorder imports, so it is they
who should be lazy on behalf of their callers.

PEP-690 (Lazy Imports, Rejected) [1] and its associated discussion threads give
more background on lazy imports.

def lazy_import(name: str):
    """Delay import of a module until one of its attributes is accessed.

    Commonly used to wrap modules that take a long time to import so that the
    importing module doesn't also take a long time to import.

    Since this changes when import happens from the import statement site to
    when the module is used, errors that would normally be raised when
    the caller imports the module will be postponed and out of context.

    Additional caveats from importlib.util.LazyLoader, which lazy_import wraps:

        This class only works with loaders that define exec_module() as control
        over what module type is used for the module is required. For those
        same reasons, the loader's create_module() method must return None or a
        type for which its __class__ attribute can be mutated along with not
        using slots. Finally, modules which substitute the object placed into
        sys.modules will not work as there is no way to properly replace the
        module references throughout the interpreter safely; ValueError is
        raised if such a substitution is detected.

    Example of use:

        import typing

        if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:
            import slow_module
        else:
            slow_module = lazy_import("slow_module")

    There are limitations to how long loading can be deferred and how a lazy
    module can be used.

    In a nested module, e.g., parent.slow_module, even if the child module
    loading is deferred, the parent module must be loaded to resolve the child
    module attribute itself:

        # Parent is loaded even if child is deferred.
        slow_module = lazy_import("parent.slow_module")

        # Deferring the parent doesn't help
        parent = lazy_import("parent")
        # ... parent must be loaded now to resolve the attribute access
        # parent.slow_module
        slow_module = lazy_import("parent.slow_module")

    For these cases, the only resolution is to move the import statement inside
    a function.

    A lazy module should only be used with direct attribute access or in part
    of a from-import statement. Other uses, like alongside a multi-level import
    statement, may result in loading states that break module invariants.

        slow_module = lazy_import("slow_module")

        # Safe uses of a lazy module
        slow_module.func()
        slow_module.FIELD
        from slow_module import sub_module

        # Unsafe uses of a lazy module
        import slow_module.sub_module

    lazy_import raises a ValueError if it detects an unsafe usage.
