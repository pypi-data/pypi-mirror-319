    ----------
    Features : DeviceFeatureMap
        A dict with features this device supports. See DeviceFeatureMap. A value of boolean `True` indicates the device supports it.
    screenWidth : int
        The total width of the screen
    screenHeight : int
        The total height of the screen
    viewWidth : int
        The viewable width of the screen, i.e. taking into account any pixels obscured by bezels for example.
    viewHeight : _type_
        The viewable height of the screen, i.e. taking into account any pixels obscured by bezels for example.
    screenMode : str
        The image mode the final images send to the `print_pil` function should be in. See https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/concepts.html#concept-modes, 
        Testing has only been done with "L" and "RGB", though the screenMode should not affect functionality as much.
    imgMode : str
        The image mode to construct images in. In general, I'd advice using 'RGBA' as it provides the best results, but the option is there for i.e. performance reasons. Not fully tested with other modes either.
    defaultColor : ColorType
