Sapguipy is designed to manipulate SAP GUI with some lines of code. It can be used to facilitate complexes RPA developments, realize tests or even to execute simple macros on SAP GUI.

### Key Features

1. **SAP Integration:** Uses SAP Script, that was especifully builded for manipulate the SAP GUI. If you never heard about, see the docs of [SAP Script](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap_gui_for_windows/b47d018c3b9b45e897faf66a6c0885a8/babdf65f4d0a4bd8b40f5ff132cb12fa.html).
2. **Flexible Configuration:** Configure to suit your needs.

## SAP Configuration
Before use this package, you must configure your SAP to accept scripts without notify.
Go to SAP configuration -> Accessbility and Scripting -> Scripting -> Uncheck the option "Notify when a script attaches to SAP GUI".

Save and you can go ahead to use this package.

## Usage:

To install this package, ensure you have Python installed.

### install with pip:

```bash
pip install sapguipy
```
### Import it
```python
from sapguipy import SapGui
```

### Run it
Fill the parameters with your SAP info and credentials:

```python
sap = SapGui(sid='PRD',user='USR',pwd='AnPassword',mandante='900',language='PT')
sap.login()
sap.start_transaction('SU01D')
```
You can use with context management too (i recommend using instead of the previous example):
```python
with SapGui(sid='PRD',user='USR',pwd='AnPassword',mandante='900',language='PT') as sap:
	sap.open_transaction('SU01D')
```

### The sky is the limit (or in this case, SAP Script)
You can do whatever you want with SAP session generated.
If the methods of this package don't do what you need, you can build for your own using SAP Script docs.
```python
with SapGui(sid='PRD',user='USR',pwd='AnPassword',mandante='900',language='PT') as sap:
	height_windows = sap.session.findById('wnd[0]').Height
	with_window = sap.session.findById('wnd[0]').Width
	status_bar_text = sap.session.findById("wnd[0]/sbar/pane[0]").text
```
### How it works
This package abstracts and padronize the most utilized methods of SAP Script. So, you can worry only about your business rules.
