# Why does this file appear?
# In fact, this project was not built from scratch. At first, I just wanted
# to complete the tasks assigned by the superior department, so I didn't think
# too much because there were many things that needed to be urgently completed.
# So some files in this project inevitably contain a large number of Chinese
# characters in their text. When this project can successfully complete many
# tasks, internationalization has become very troublesome and difficult to
# start (and I don't have that much time). So, this file is responsible for
# translating an international copy.


# The end.
