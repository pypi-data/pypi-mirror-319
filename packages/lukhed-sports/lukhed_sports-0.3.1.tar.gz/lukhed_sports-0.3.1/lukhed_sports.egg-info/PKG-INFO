A collection of sports analysis utility functions and API wrappers

```bash
pip install lukhed-sports
```


## Sportspage Feeds Wrapper
This class is a custom wrapper for the [sportspagefeeds API](https://sportspagefeeds.com/documentation). 

It provides:
- Management of api key -> You can store api key locally (by default) or with a private github repo 
    so you can use the api efficiently across different hardware.
- Optionally manage api limits (on by default) 
- Methods to utilize each endpoint from sportspagefeeds
- Optionally validate input (on by default), to ensure you do not waste API calls
- Methods to get valid inputs for each endpoint, as documentation is sparse
- Methods to parse data returned by basic (non-paid) endpoints 

Full documentation for this class is in development.

### Basic Usage
```python
from lukhed_sports import SportsPage
```

#### API Key Management Locally
```python
# Upon first use, class will take you thru setup (copy and paste your Sportspage key)
api = SportsPage()
games = api.get_games('nfl')
```

#### API Key Managment with Private Github Repo
```python
# Upon first use, class will take you thru setup (github token and Sportspage key)
api = SportsPage(
    config_file_preference='github', 
    github_project='any_project_name'
    )
```

#### Games
```python
# Get games occuring today
api.get_games('nfl')
```
