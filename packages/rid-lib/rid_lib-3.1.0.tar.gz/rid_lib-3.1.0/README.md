# RID v3 Protocol

*This specification can be understood as the third iteration of the RID protocol, or RID v3. Previous versions include [RID v1](https://github.com/BlockScience/kms-identity/blob/main/README.md) and [RID v2](https://github.com/BlockScience/rid-lib/blob/v2/README.md).*
## Introduction

*Note: throughout this document the terms "resource", "digital object", and "knowledge object" are used roughly interchangeably.*

Reference Identifiers (RIDs) identify references to resources primarily for usage within Knowledge Organization Infrastructure (KOI). The RID specification is informed by previous work on representing digital objects (see [Objects as Reference](https://blog.block.science/objects-as-reference-toward-robust-first-principles-of-digital-organization/)) in which objects are identified through a relationship between a reference and a referent. Under this model, RIDs are the *references*, and the resources they refer to are the *referents.* The *means of reference* describes the relationship between the reference and referent.

```
(reference) -[means of reference]-> (referent)
```

As opposed to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), RIDs are not intended to have universal agreement or a centralized management structure. However, RIDs are compatible with URIs in that *all URIs can be valid RIDs*. [RFC 3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3986) outlines the basic properties of an URI, adding that "a URI can be further classified as a locator, a name or both." Location and naming can be considered two different means of reference, or methods of linking a reference and referent(s), where:

1. Locators identify resources by *where* they are, with the referent being defined as the resource retrieved via a defined access method. This type of identifier is less stable, and the resource at the specified location could change or become unavailable over time.
3. Names identify resources by *what* they are, acting as a more stable, location independent identifier. Resources identified by name are not always intended to be accessed, but some may be resolvable to locators. While the mapping from name to locator may not be constant the broader relationship between reference and referent should be.
## Generic Syntax

The generic syntax to compose an RID roughly mirrors URIS:
```
<context>:<reference>
```

Conceptually, the reference refers to the referent, while the context provides context for how to interpret the reference, or how to discriminate it from another otherwise identical RID. While in many cases the context simply maps to a URI scheme, the context may also include part of the "hierarchical part" (right hand side of a URI following the scheme).
## Object Reference Names (previously RID v2)

The major change from RID v2 to v3 was building compatibility with URIs, and as a result the previous RID v2 style identifiers are now implemented under the (unofficial) `orn:` URI scheme. 

Object Reference Names (ORNs) identify references to objects, or resources identified independent of their access method. Given the previous definitions of identifiers, ORNs can be considered "names". They are intended to be used with existing resources which may already have well defined identifiers. An ORN identifies a resource by "dislocating" it from a specific access mechanism, maintaining a reference even if the underlying locator changes or breaks. ORNs are generally formed from one or more context specific identifiers which can be easily accessed for processing in other contexts.

ORNs are composed using the following syntax:
```
orn:<namespace>:<reference>
```
*Note: In previous versions, the namespace was split into `<space>.<form>`. Using a dot to separate a namespace in this way is still encouraged, but is not explicitly defined by this specification.*

ORNs also implement a more complex context component: `orn:<namespace>`. The differences between the syntax of ORNs and generic URIs are summarized here:
```
<scheme>:<hierarchical-part>
\______/ \_________________/
    |                |
 context         reference
 ___|_________   ____|____
/             \ /         \
orn:<namespace>:<reference>
```

## Examples

In the current version there are two example implementations of RID types: HTTP/S URLs and Slack objects. The HTTP/S scheme is the most commonly used form of URI and uses the standard RID parsing, where the scheme `http` or `https` is equal to the context, and the hierarchical part is equal to the reference. 

```
scheme  authority                  path
 _|_     ____|___  _________________|___________________
/   \   /        \/                                     \
https://github.com/BlockScience/rid-lib/blob/v3/README.md
\___/ \_________________________________________________/
  |                           |
context                   reference
```

The Slack objects are implemented as ORNs, and include workspaces, channels, messages, and users. The Slack message object's namespace is `slack.message` and its reference component is composed of three internal identifiers, the workspace id, channel id, and message id.

```
scheme namespace     team      channel      timestamp
 |   _____|_____   ___|___    ____|___   _______|_______
/ \ /           \ /       \ /         \ /               \
orn:slack.message:TA2E6KPK3/C07BKQX0EVC/1721669683.087619
\_______________/ \_____________________________________/
        |                            |
     context                     reference
```

By representing Slack messages through ORNs, a stable identifier can be assigned to a resource which can be mapped to existing locators for different use cases. For example, a Slack message can be represented as a shareable link which redirects to the Slack app or in browser app: 
```
https://blockscienceteam.slack.com/archives/C07BKQX0EVC/p1721669683087619`
```
There's also a "deep link" which can open the Slack app directly (but only to a channel):
```
slack://open?team=TA2E6KPK3&id=C07BKQX0EVC
```
Finally, there's the backend API call to retrieve the JSON data associated with the message:
```
https://slack.com/api/conversations.replies?channel=C07BKQX0EVC&ts=1721669683.087619&limit=1
```
These three different locators have specific use cases, but none of them work well as long term identifiers of a Slack message. None of them contain all of the identifiers needed to uniquely identify the message (the shareable link comes close, but uses the mutable team name instead of the id). Even if a locator can fully describe an object of interested, it is not resilient to changes in access method and is not designed for portability into systems where the context needs to be clearly stated and internal identifiers easily extracted. Instead, we can represent a Slack message as an ORN and resolve it to any of the above locators when necessary.

## Implementation

The RID class provides a template for all RID types and access to a global constructor. All RID instances have access to the following properties:
```python
scheme: str
namespace: str | None # defined for ORNs

context: str          # "orn:<namespace>" for ORNs, otherwise equal to scheme
reference: str        # the component after namespace component for ORNs, otherwise after the scheme component
```
and the following methods:
```python
def from_string(string: str): ... # returns instance of RID
def from_reference(string: str): ... # returns instance of RID, only callable from RID type classes, not base class
```

In order to create an RID type, follow this minimal implementation:
```python
class TypeName:
	# define scheme for a generic URI type
	scheme = "scheme"
	# OR a namespace for a ORN type
	namespace = "namespace"

	# instantiates a new RID from internal components
	def __init__(self, internal_id):
		self.internal_id = internal_id
	
	# returns the reference component
	@property
	def reference(self):
		# should dynamically reflect changes to any internal ids
		return self.internal_id
	
	# instantiates of an RID of this type given a reference
	@classmethod
	def from_reference(cls, reference):
		# in a typical use case, the reference would need to be parsed
		return cls(reference)
```

```

## Usage

RIDs are intended to be used as a lightweight, cross platform identifiers to facilitate communication between knowledge processing systems. RID objects can be constructed from any RID string using the general constructor `RID.from_string`. The parser will match the string's context component and call the corresponding `from_reference` constructor. This can also be done directly on any context class via `Context.from_reference`. Finally, each context class provides a default constructor which requires each subcomponent to be indvidiually specified.
```python
from rid_lib import RID
from rid_lib.types import SlackMessage

rid_obj1 = RID.from_string("orn:slack.message:TA2E6KPK3/C07BKQX0EVC/1721669683.087619")
rid_obj2 = SlackMessage.from_reference("TA2E6KPK3/C07BKQX0EVC/1721669683.087619")
rid_obj3 = SlackMessage(team_id="TA2E6KPK3", channel_id="C07BKQX0EVC", ts="1721669683.087619")

assert rid_obj1 == rid_obj2 == rid_obj3

# guaranteed to be defined for all RID objects
print(rid_obj1.scheme, rid_obj1.context, rid_obj1.reference)

# special parameters for the slack.message context
print(rid_obj1.team_id, rid_obj1.channel_id, rid_obj1.ts)
```

If an RID type hasn't been implemented as a context class, it can still be parsed by the general constructor if provisional contexts are allowed. In this case a provisional context class is generated on the fly providing the minimal RID type implementation (`reference` property, `from_reference` class method, `__init__` function).

```python
test_obj1 = RID.from_string("test:one", allow_prov_ctx=True)
test_obj2 = RID.from_string("test:one", allow_prov_ctx=True)

assert test_obj1 == test_obj2
```
