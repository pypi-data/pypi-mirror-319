# Digifarm converter for fiboa
# First draft just takes in a file saved from the API.
# It'd be ideal if there was a CLI that took a Digifarm token and BBOX and would save the file locally and
# convert it. Not sure if we want to keep loading functionality into the converter, if we have a new
# CLI tool that could query field boundary API's - I'd see DigiFarm and Onesoil as options, where you could
# do like 'fiboa api-request digifarm --bbox 4,12,5,13 --token blah | fiboa convert digifarm -i -'.

Data must be obtained from the Digifarm API, see https://api-docs.digifarm.io/.
Use the `-i` CLI parameter to provide the data source.
Provide a URL to an API request (e.g. `https://api.digifarm.io/v1/delineated-fields?token=...&bbox=11.13,60.72,11.21,60.76`)
or download the API response to a local GeoJSON file (use `.json` as file extension).
