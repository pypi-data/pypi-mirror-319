# voice_code Project

This wheel enables text input through voice and clicking, eliminating the need for a keyboard.
## Key Advantages:

Here is a widget for quick correction of approximate words, automatic punctuation, and quick deletion.
The factors that affect the accuracy of letter recognition include pronunciation accuracy, volume level, and word pronunciation intervals. 
If you accurately pronounce the first two sounds of a word, you can expect an accurate result.
You can read softly in the process of collecting similar words.
Now you can use voice and clicking to realize accurate text input.
