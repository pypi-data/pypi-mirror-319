# pandoc-tex-numbering
This is an all-in-one pandoc filter especially for LaTeX files to keep **numbering, hyperlinks, caption prefixs and cross references in (maybe multi-line) equations, sections, figures, and tables**.

With `pandoc-tex-numbering`, you can convert your LaTeX source codes to any format pandoc supported, especially `.docx`, while **keep all your auto-numberings and cross references**.

# Installation

First, install `pandoc` and `python3` if you haven't.

`pandoc-tex-numbering` can be installed via `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandoc-tex-numbering
```

You can also download the source code manually and put it in the same directory as your source file. In this case, when using the filter, you should specify the filter file via `-F pandoc-tex-numbering.py` instead of `-F pandoc-tex-numbering`.

# Quick Start

Take `.docx` as an example:

```bash
pandoc -F pandoc-tex-numbering -o output.docx input.tex 
```

# Customization

You can set the following variables in the metadata of your LaTeX file to customize the behavior of the filter:

## General
- `number-figures`: Whether to number the figures. Default is `true`.
- `number-tables`: Whether to number the tables. Default is `true`.
- `number-equations`: Whether to number the equations. Default is `true`.
- `number-sections`: Whether to number the sections. Default is `true`.
- `number-reset-level`: The level of the section that will reset the numbering. Default is 1. For example, if the value is 2, the numbering will be reset at every second-level section and shown as "1.1.1", "3.2.1" etc.
- `data-export-path`: Where to export the filter data. Default is `None`, which means no data will be exported. If set, the data will be exported to the specified path in the JSON format. This is useful for further usage of the filter data in other scripts or filter-debugging.
- `auto-labelling`: Whether to automatically add identifiers (labels) to figures and tables without labels. Default is `true`. This has no effect on the output appearance but can be useful for cross-referencing in the future (for example, in the `.docx` output this will ensure that all your figures and tables have a unique auto-generated bookmark).

## Equations
- `multiline-environments`: Possible multiline environment names separated by commas. Default is "cases,align,aligned,gather,multline,flalign". The equations under these environments will be numbered line by line.

## `cleveref` Support
Currently, pandoc's default LaTeX reader does not support `\crefname` and `\Crefname` commands (they are not visible in the AST for filters). To support cleveref package, you can set the following metadata:
- `figure-prefix`: The prefix of the figure reference. Default is "Figure".
- `table-prefix`: The prefix of the table reference. Default is "Table".
- `equation-prefix`: The prefix of the equation reference. Default is "Equation".
- `section-prefix`: The prefix of the section reference. Default is "Section".
- `prefix-space`: Whether to add a space between the prefix and the number. Default is `true` (for some languages, the space may not be needed).

**Note: multiple references are not supported currently.** Try to use `Figures \ref{fig:1} and \ref{fig:2}` instead of `\cref{fig:1,fig:2}` for now.

## Custom Section Numbering Format
For the section numbering, you can customize the format of the section numbering added at the beginning of the section titles and used in the references. The following metadata are used. For more details, see the [Details of Sections](#sections) section.
- `section-format-source-1`, `section-format-source-2`,...: The format of the section numbering at each level. Default is `"{h1}"`, `"{h1}.{h2}"` etc.
- `section-format-ref-1`, `section-format-ref-2`,...: The format of the section numbering used in the references. **If set, this will override the `section-prefix` metadata**. Default is `"{h1}"`, `"{h1}.{h2}"`, etc. combined with the `section-prefix` and `prefix-space` metadata.

## Subfigure Support
You can use the `subcaption` package to create subfigures. The filter will automatically number the subfigures. You can customize the subfigure numbering by setting the following metadata:
- `subfigure-symbols`: The symbols used for subfigure numbering. Default is `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"`. The symbols will be used in the order specified. You must ensure that the number of symbols is greater than or equal to the number of subfigures in a figure.
- `subfigure-format`: The format of the subfigures used in captions and references. This is a python f-string format similar to the section numbering format. Default is `"{sym}"`. The available fields are `sym` and `num`. `sym` is the symbol of the subfigure and `num` is the number of the subfigure. For example, if you set `subfigure-format="({sym})"`(i.e. parentheses around the symbol), the subfigures will be shown as "(a)", "(b)" etc. in the captions and references.

## List of Figures and Tables
To support short captions and custom titles in the list of figures and tables, you can set the following metadata to turn on the custom list of figures and tables:
- `custom-lof`: Whether to use a custom list of figures. Default is `false`.
- `custom-lot`: Whether to use a custom list of tables. Default is `false`.

NOTE: **pass `-f latex+raw_tex` to the pandoc command if you want to put the lists at the correct position.** This is because the filter cannot get access to the position of the lists in the LaTeX source code unless the `raw_tex` extension is enabled. **If `raw_tex` is not enabled or the `\listoffigures` and `\listoftables` commands are not found, the lists will be put at the beginning of the document.**

You can customize the list of figures and tables by setting the following metadata:
- `lof-title`: The title of the list of figures. Default is "List of Figures".
- `lot-title`: The title of the list of tables. Default is "List of Tables".
- `list-leader-type`: The type of leader used in the list of figures and tables (placeholders between the caption and the page number). Default is "dots". Possible values are "dot", "hyphen", "underscore", "middleDot" and "none".

## Caption Renaming
The `figure-prefix` and `table-prefix` metadata are also used to rename the captions of figures and tables (but they are not used in subfigures and subtables).

# Details

## Equations

If metadata `number-equations` is set to `true`, all the equations will be numbered. The numbers are added at the end of the equations and the references to the equations are replaced by their numbers.

Equations under multiline environments (specified by metadata `multiline-environments` ) such as `align`, `cases` etc. are numbered line by line, and the others are numbered as a whole block.

That is to say, if you want the filter to number multiline equations line by line, use `align`, `cases` etc. environments directly. If you want the filter to number the whole block as a whole, use `split`, `aligned` etc. environments in the `equation` environment. In multiline environments, **`\nonumber` commands are supported** to turn off the numbering of a specific line.

For example, as shown in `test_data/test.tex`:

```latex
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        f(x) &= x^2 + 2x + 1 \\
        g(x) &= \sin(x)
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}
```

This equation will be numbered as a whole block, say, (1.1), while:

```latex
\begin{align}
    a &= b + c \label{eq:align1} \\
    d &= e - f \label{eq:align2} \\
    g &= h \nonumber \\
    i &= j + k \label{eq:align3}
\end{align}
```

This equation will be numbered line by line, say, (1.2), (1.3) and (1.4), while the third line will not be numbered.

**NOTE: the pandoc filters have no access to the difference of `align` and `align*` environments.** Therefore, you CANNOT turn off the numbering of a specific `align` environment via the `*` mark. If you do want to turn off the numbering of a specific `align` environment, a temporary solution is to manually add `\nonumber` commands to every line of the environment. *This may be fixed by a custom lua reader to keep those information in the future.*

## Sections

If metadata `number-sections` is set to `true`, all the sections will be numbered. The numbers are added at the beginning of the section titles and the references to the sections are replaced by their numbers.

You can customize the format of the section numbering added at the beginning of the section titles and used in the references by setting the metadata `section-format-source-1`, `section-format-source-2`, etc. and `section-format-ref-1`, `section-format-ref-2`, etc. All of these metadata accept a python f-string format with fields `h1`, `h2`, ..., `h10` representing the numbers of each level headers. 

For example, to add a prefix "Chapter" and a suffix "." to the first-level section, you can set `section-format-source-1` to `"Chapter {h1}."`. At the beginning of the first-level section, it will be shown as "Chapter 1.". And if you also want to add the prefix "Chapter" to the references, but without the suffix ".", you can set `section-format-ref-1` to `"Chapter {h1}"`. Then, when a first-level section is referred to, it will be shown as "Chapter 1".

The default values of `section-format-source-1`, `section-format-source-2`, etc. are in fact `{h1}`, `{h1}.{h2}`, etc. respectively, and the default values of `section-format-ref-1`, `section-format-ref-2`, etc. are in fact `{h1}`, `{h1}.{h2}` combined with the `section-prefix` and `prefix-space` metadata respectively.

Sometimes, non arabic numberings are needed. For example, in Chinese, with `section-format-source-1="第{h1}章"`, the users get "第1章", "第2章" etc. However, sometimes the users may need "第一章", "第二章" etc. To achieve this, we also support non arabic numbers by series of **non-arabic fields**. For example, when `{h1}` is 12, the Chinese number field `{h1_zh}` will be "十二".

Note that: The current version only supports simplified Chinese numbers. If you need other languages, you can modify the `lang_num.py` file. See the [Custom Non-Arabic Numbers Support](#custom-non-arabic-numbers-support) section for more details.

## Figures and Tables

All the figures and tables are supported. All references to figures and tables are replaced by their numbers, and all the captions are added prefixs such as "Figure 1.1: ".

You can determine the prefix of figures and tables by changing the variables `figure-prefix` and `table-prefix` in the metadata, default values are "Figure" and "Table" respectively.

All figures and captions without captions will be also added a caption like "Figure 1.1" or "Table 1.1" (without the colon).

## Data Export

If you set the metadata `data-export-path` to a path, the filter will export the filter data to the specified path in the JSON format. This is useful for further usage of the filter data in other scripts or filter debugging. The output data is a dictionary with identifiers (labels) as keys and the corresponding data as values.

All kinds of identifiers have the following common keys: `num: str` and `type: Literal["fig", "tab", "eq", "sec"]`. For sections, there is an additional key `level: int` representing the level of the section. For tables and figures, there is additional keys `caption: str` and `short_caption: str` representing the full caption and the short caption defined in the LaTeX source code.

Note: currently, short captions defined via `\caption[short caption]{full caption}` are not supported for `docx` output, but the filter will export them for your further usage.

## Log

Some warning message will be shown in the log file named `pandoc-tex-numbering.log` in the same directory as the output file. You can check this file if you encounter any problems or report those messages in the issues.


## `org` file support

`org` files are supported by adding an additional lua filter `src\org_helper.lua` to the pandoc command. The usage is as follows:

```bash
pandoc --lua-filter org_helper.lua --filter pandoc-tex-numbering.py input.org -o output.docx
```

**Be sure to use `--lua-filter org_helper.lua` before `--filter pandoc-tex-numbering.py`**.

Reason for this is the default `org` reader of `pandoc` does not parse LaTeX codes by default, for example, LaTeX equations in `equation` environments and cross references via `\ref{}` macros are parsed as `RawBlock` and `RawInline` nodes, while we desire `Math` nodes and `Link` nodes respectively. The `org_helper.lua` filter helps read these blocks via `latex` reader and after that, the `pandoc-tex-numbering.py` filter can work as expected.

Related discussions can also be found in [pandoc issue #1764](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1764) (codes in `org_helper.lua` are based on comments from @tarleb in this issue) and [pandoc-tex-numbering issue #1](https://github.com/fncokg/pandoc-tex-numbering/issues/1).

# Examples

With the testing file `tests/test.tex`:

## Default Metadata

```bash
pandoc -o output.docx -F pandoc-tex-numbering test.tex 
```

The results are shown as follows:

![alt text](https://github.com/fncokg/pandoc-tex-numbering/blob/main/images/default-page2.jpg?raw=true)

## Customized Metadata

In the following example, we custom the following (maybe silly) items *only for the purpose of demonstration*:
- Use all prefixes as "Fig", "Tab", "Eq" respectively.
- Reset the numbering at the second level sections, such that the numbering will be shown as "1.1.1", "3.2.1" etc.
- At the beginning of sections, use Chinese numbers "第一章" for the first level sections and English numbers "Section 1.1" for the second level sections.
- When referred to, use, in turn, "Chapter 1", "第1.1节" etc.
- For subfigures, use greek letters combined with arabic numbers and replace the parentheses with square brackets, such that the subfigures will be shown as "[α1]", "[β2]" etc.
- Turn on custom list of figures and tables and:
  - Use custom titles as "图片目录" and "Table Lists" respectively.
  - Use hyphens as the leader in the lists.

Run the following command with corresponding metadata in a `metadata.yaml` file (**recommended**):

```bash
pandoc -o output.docx -F pandoc-tex-numbering --metadata-file test.yaml -f latex+raw_tex test.tex
```

```yaml
# test.yaml
figure-prefix: Fig
table-prefix: Tab
equation-prefix: Eq
number-reset-level: 2
non-arabic-numbers: true
section-format-source-1: "第{h1_zh}章"
section-format-source-2: "Section {h1}.{h2}."
section-format-ref-1: "Chapter {h1}"
section-format-ref-2: "第{h1}.{h2}节"
subfigure-format: "[{sym}({num})]"
subfigure-symbols: "αβγδεζηθικλμνξοπρστυφχψω"
custom-lot: true
custom-lof: true
lot-title: "Table List"
lof-title: "图片目录"
list-leader-type: "hyphen"
```

The results are shown as follows:

# Development

## Custom Non-Arabic Numbers Support

Currently, the filter supports only Chinese non-arabic numbers. If you want to support other languages, you can modify the `lang_num.py` file. For example, if you want to support the non-arabic numbers in the language `foo`, you can:

1. Define a new function `arabic2foo(num:int)->str` that converts the arabic number to the corresponding non-arabic number.
2. Add the function to the `language_functions` dictionary with the corresponding language name as the key, for example `{"foo":arabic2foo}`.

Then you can set the metadata `section-format-1="Chapter {h1_foo}."` to enable the non-arabic numbers in the filter.

## Custom Numbering Format

To keep the design of the filter simple and easy to use, the filter only supports a limited number of numbering formats. However, complex formats can easily be extended by modifying the logic in the `action_replace_refs` function.

## Extend the Filter

The logical structure of the filter is quiet straightforward. You can see this filter as a scaffold for your own filter. For example, `_parse_multiline_environment` function receives a latex math node and the doc object and returns a new modified math string with the numbering and respective labels. You can add your customized latex syntax analysis logic to support more complicated circumstances.

It is recommended to decalre all your possible variables in the `prepare` function, and save them in the `doc.pandoc_tex_numbering:dict` object. This object will be automatically destroyed after the filter is executed.

## Advanced docx Support

In `oxml.py`, I added a built-in framework to support high-level OOXML operations. If you're familiar with OOXML, you can utilize this framework to embed OOXML codes directly into the output (into `RawBlock` nodes with `openxml` format).

# FAQ

- **Q: Can the filter work with xxx package?**
- **A**: It depends. If the package is supported by pandoc, then it should work. If not, you may need to a custom filter or reader to parse the LaTeX codes correctly. In the latter case, this is out of the scope of this filter. For example, the macro `\ce` in the `mhchem` package is not supported by pandoc, so we cannot parse the chemical equations correctly.
- **Q: Can the filter support complex caption macros such as `\bicaption`?**
- **A**: No for now. Caption macros such as `\bicaption` are not supported by the default `latex` reader of pandoc. Therefore, we cannot parse them correctly. You may need a custom reader to parse them correctly or modify the source code before using this filter.
- **Q: Can `docx` output support the short captions in the list of figures and tables?**
- **A**: Now supported.

That said, however, functionalities mentioned above can never be supported easily since they are not, and maybe never will be, supported by native `pandoc` framework.

# TODO

There are some known issues and possible improvements:
- [ ] Support multiple references in `cleveref` package.
- [x] Add empty caption for figures and tables without captions (currently, they have no caption and therefore links to them cannot be located).
- [ ] Directly support `align*` and other non-numbered environments.
- [x] Subfigure support.
- [x] Support short captions in `docx` output.
