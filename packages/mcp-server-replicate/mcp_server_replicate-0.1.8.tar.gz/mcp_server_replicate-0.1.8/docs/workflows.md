# MCP Server Workflow Patterns

## Text-to-Image Generation

The text-to-image workflow is designed to help users find and use the right model for their specific needs. The workflow follows these steps:

1. **Initial User Input**

   - User provides their requirements through the `text_to_image` prompt
   - System guides them to specify:
     - Subject matter
     - Style preferences
     - Quality requirements
     - Technical requirements (size, etc.)

2. **Model Discovery**

   - System uses `search_available_models` to find suitable models
   - Models are scored based on:
     - Popularity (run count)
     - Featured status
     - Version stability
     - Tag matching
     - Task relevance
   - Results are sorted but presented to user for selection

3. **Model Selection**

   - User can view model details using `get_model_details`
   - System provides guidance on model capabilities
   - User makes final model selection
   - System confirms version to use

4. **Parameter Configuration**

   - System applies quality presets based on user requirements
   - Style presets are applied if specified
   - Size and other parameters are configured
   - User can override any parameters

5. **Image Generation**
   - System uses `generate_image` with selected model and parameters
   - Progress is tracked
   - Results are validated
   - Retry logic handles failures

### Example Flow

```python
# 1. User provides requirements through text_to_image prompt
response = await text_to_image()

# 2. Search for models based on requirements
models = await search_available_models(
    query="cat portrait",
    style="photorealistic"
)

# 3. Get details for user's chosen model
model = await get_model_details("stability-ai/sdxl")

# 4. Generate image with chosen model
result = await generate_image(
    model_version=model.latest_version.id,
    prompt="a photorealistic cat portrait",
    style="photorealistic",
    quality="balanced"
)
```

### Key Principles

1. **User Agency**

   - System suggests but doesn't decide
   - User makes final model selection
   - Parameters can be overridden

2. **Transparency**

   - Model scoring is visible
   - Capabilities are clearly communicated
   - Limitations are disclosed

3. **Flexibility**

   - Multiple models can be used
   - Parameters are customizable
   - Quality/style presets are optional

4. **Reliability**
   - Version stability is considered
   - Error handling is robust
   - Progress is tracked

## Template Usage

Templates provide consistent parameter sets but should be used flexibly:

1. **Quality Presets**

   - Provide baseline parameters
   - Can be overridden
   - Match user's speed/quality needs

2. **Style Presets**

   - Enhance prompts
   - Add style-specific parameters
   - Are optional and customizable

3. **Aspect Ratio Presets**
   - Match common use cases
   - Ensure valid dimensions
   - Can be customized

## Error Handling

1. **Model Selection**

   - Handle no matches gracefully
   - Provide alternatives
   - Explain limitations

2. **Parameter Validation**

   - Validate before submission
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Suggest corrections

3. **Generation Failures**
   - Implement retry logic
   - Track progress
   - Provide status updates

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**

   - Always let user choose model
   - Provide scoring context
   - Explain trade-offs

2. **Parameter Configuration**

   - Use presets as starting points
   - Allow customization
   - Validate combinations

3. **Error Handling**

   - Be proactive about potential issues
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Implement proper retry logic

4. **User Interaction**
   - Guide don't decide
   - Explain options
   - Respect user choices
