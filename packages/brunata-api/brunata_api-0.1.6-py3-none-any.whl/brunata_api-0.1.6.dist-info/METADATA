## ⚠️ Please ensure your Brunata credentials work on [online.brunata.com][brunata] ⚠️

If your credentials don't work **AND** you use a different Brunata portal to view your metrics, please open an issue and/or merge request.

In most cases, you will likely have to add support for alternate portals yourself; I will gladly assist you in getting the authentication-flow working and finding the API endpoints. Then you can simply submit a Pull Request, and I'll review it when I have time 🙂

### The integration can fetch the following metrics

- 📊 Available meter types

- ⚡ Energy meters

- 💧 Water meters

- 🔥 Heating meters

- Measurement units used by meters

- Total consumption per meter

## Contributions are welcome!

If you want to contribute to this please read the [Contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Active Directory B2C Login-flow was mostly based on [@itchannel](https://github.com/itchannel)'s [FordPass Integration][fordpass]
