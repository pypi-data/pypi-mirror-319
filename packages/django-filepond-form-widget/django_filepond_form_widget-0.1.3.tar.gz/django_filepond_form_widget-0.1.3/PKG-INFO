## Features
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrates FilePond with Django forms.
- **Image Preview**: Provides image preview functionality out of the box.
- **Customization**: Configurable options to tailor the widget to your needs.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Simple Form Submission**: Focuses on regular file field submissions with forms, without handling server API endpoints.
- **Language Selection**: Automatically sets the locale based on the current language, ensuring the FilePond interface matches the user's language preferences.
- **Extensible**: Support for additional FilePond plugins planned for future releases.

Note: This widget is designed to work with standard form submissions. While FilePond's server property can be configured for API endpoints, this is beyond the scope of this project which aims to provide a simple form widget implementation.

## Installation
Install the package using pip:

```
pip install django-filepond-form-widget
```

Alternatively, you can install it from the repository:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/krystofbe/django-filepond-form-widget.git
```



## Usage
### Add to Installed Apps

Add `django_filepond_form_widget` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [

```

### Include Static Files

Ensure that your templates include the necessary static files. Typically, this is handled automatically by the widget's media.

### Use the Widget in Forms

```
from django import forms
from django_filepond_form_widget.widgets import FilePondWidget


class ExampleForm(forms.Form):
    image = forms.FileField(
        widget=FilePondWidget(
            config={"allowImagePreview": True, "allowMultiple": False}
        )
    )
```

### Create Views and Templates

```
from django.shortcuts import render
from .forms import ExampleForm


def upload_view(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        form = ExampleForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            # Handle uploaded file
            return render(request, "example_app/success.html")
    else:
        form = ExampleForm()
    return render(request, "example_app/upload.html", {"form": form})
```
