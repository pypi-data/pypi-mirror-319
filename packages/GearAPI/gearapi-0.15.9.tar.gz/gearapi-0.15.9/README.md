This is a Python client for the Cumulocity Data API. The GearAPI package is a wrapper to simplify GET requests and JSON response parsing from the Measurement and Event Resources. 

This library abstracts:
1. API endpoint handling
2. pagnation handling
3. API retry
4. file handling
5. Handling API from multiple devices 

## how to use

2. `pip install GearAPI`


```
from GearAPI import Client

client = Client(
    user = <IoT Platform User Name>
    password = <IoT Platform User Password>
)

date_start = "2024-08-01"
date_end = "2024-08-02"
device_params = {
    "devicetype": "iaq"
}
output_file_path = "output.csv"

client.download(
    date_start, 
    date_end, 
    output_file_path = output_file_path, 
    device_params = device_params)

"""
output: all the iaq devices data from 2024-08-01 to 2024-08-02
"""
