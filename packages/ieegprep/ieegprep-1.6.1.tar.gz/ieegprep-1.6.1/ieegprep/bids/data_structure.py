    """
    Search and list the subjects and datasets for a given BIDS directory. The BIDS directory functions as a search
    starting point and can point to  any depth of the BIDS structure. Only datasets that are found (recursively) from
    that search depth are included.

    Args:
        bids_search_directory (str):        The BIDS directory to search subject and datasets in
        dataset_extensions (list/tuple):    The file extensions that will be considered as datasets. If set to None (default)
                                            all the readable dataset formats will be considered (EDF, BrainVision, MEF3)
        subjects_filter (list/tuple):       Optional list of subjects to include. If set, then any subject found that is
                                            not included in this list will be excluded from the results. Pass
                                            None (default) to include all found subjects.
        subset_search_pattern (str/list):   Optional search string or tuple/list of search strings. If a dataset name
                                            contains any of these subset patterns, then it will be included in the search
                                            results. Set to None (default) to include all datasets.
        strict_search (bool):               List only subjects and datasets that abide (more) strictly to the BIDS folder
                                            and filename structure, such as whether to require a dataset to be in a modality
                                            folder and matching of the subject-label between dataset names and their directories.
                                            Set to True to be more strict, False (default) for less strict searching.
        only_subjects_with_subsets (bool):  Whether to list a subject in the results that has no listed datasets after
                                            applying the search arguments (dataset_extensions, subjects_filter and
                                            subset_search_pattern) in it. Set to True in order to only add subjects to
                                            the results that have any datasets. False (default) to also list subjects
                                            without datasets.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with subjects and their corresponding datasets. The keys of the dictionary represent the
        subject-labels. Each dictionary value holds a list with paths to datasets for that specific subject.
