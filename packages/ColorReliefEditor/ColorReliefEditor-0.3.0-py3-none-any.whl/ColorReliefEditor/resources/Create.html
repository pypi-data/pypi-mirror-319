<p>This tab creates full-size hillshade and color images and then merges them into a relief image.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p><b>Create:</b> Click Create to generate the
    final full-size image for this layer.</p>
<p><b>View:</b> Launches an external viewer to display the full-size image. The default system viewer is the default but QGIS is
    highly recommended instead. You can change this in the expert mode Settings tab</p>

<!-- Expert Settings section is shown or hidden depending on app mode -->
<div class="expert-section">
    <p>Expert Settings</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Calc:</b> The calculation for combining the hillshade (A) and color (B) layers. The default is a
            composite multiply.
        </li>
        <li><b>Quiet Mode:</b></li>
        <li>-q will show minimal output.</li>
        <li>-v show detailed progress</li>
        <li>--version show detailed progress and gdal version</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Publish:</b> Clicking Publish will copy the image file for the current layer to the destination folder.</p>
<p><b>Publish To:</b> The destination folder to copy the image to when Publish is clicked. Click on field and enter full
    path.</p>
<p><b>Delete Temp:</b> This will delete intermediate files for this layer. Use this when you are done with a project to
    free space.
    The intermediate files significantly speed up image creation.</p><br>
    <br>
    <p>Use the Elevation Tab to switch the active layer</p>
    <p>If you have multiple layers, you need to run Create and Publish for each layer.</p>
</div>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The output window is mainly to show progress. You only need to read the details if there is a problem.</p>
<p>The app will display 'Done' when the image is successfully built. Click View to view it externally.</p>
<p>"Create" runs multiple processes in parallel, so the output may be garbled.</p>
