<p>This tab creates and opens Color Relief projects. A project stores all the hillshade and color settings needed to create a relief image</p>
<h3>Create a Project</h3>
<ol>
<li>Click <i>New</i>. A dialog will appear to create and then open the project folder. A sample color ramp and
    settings file will be copied to this folder.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create an image</h3>
<p>Follow these steps to generate your relief image:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Select the <strong>Elevation</strong> tab to download and configure Digital Elevation files.</li>
                <li>Adjust and preview hillshade and color settings in the <strong>Hillshade</strong> and <strong>Color</strong> tabs.</li>
                <li>Finally, use the <strong>Create</strong> tab to produce a full-sized merged image, combining the hillshade and color relief.</li>
            </ol>

<h3>Modes</h3>
<b>Basic Mode:</b>
<ul>
    <li>A simplified interface for common settings.</li>
</ul>
<b>Expert Mode:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Offers control over all settings</li>
    <li>Supports the use of multiple layers, each with its own elevation files but sharing hillshade and color relief
        settings.
    </li>
</ul>
<!-- Expert Settings section is shown or hidden depending on app mode -->
<div class="expert-section">
    <p>Optionally provides two additional tabs for access to every setting by setting "Tabs" to Extended in the Project
        window:
    </p>
    <p><b>Misc:</b> Rarely changed GDAL settings.(Only in expert/extended mode)</p>
    <p><b>Settings:</b> Update general application settings.(Only in expert/extended mode)</p>

<b>What is a Project?</b>
<p>A project defines the style for the  relief image including all color settings, hillshade
<b>What is a Layer?</b>
<p>A layer is a set of contiguous elevation files with the same
    resolution.  In basic mode, a project just has one layer.  In expert mode, a project can have multiple layers all
    using the same project style.  One use for layers is to have higher resolution images with the same style, such as a layer for US,
    and a higher resolution layer for Washington, and a higher resolution layer for Mt Rainier.  Another is to have separate,
discontinuous layers such as a layer for Mt Rainier and a layer for Mt Saint Helens.</p>
