"""empty message

This file contains extra commands to be added when editing manually the
Alembic migration initial script.

Commands are commented once (i.e, with one # character) to avoid any error in the code.
To get them just uncomment the file and take the commands.

When editing the script make sure that the header is correct,
i.e., revision, down_revision, branch_labels, depends_on

TODO - Automatized this task if possible
