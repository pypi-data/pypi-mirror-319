# gh-actions-deliver-python-package

Custom GitHub Action to deliver a python package to a pypi repository ([test.]pypi.org, or pypi.uoregon.edu).

## GitHub Self-Hosted Runner Requirements

- python (3.11 default)
- [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/)
- [build](https://pypi.org/project/build/)


## Examples

Below are examples for testing and delivering python packages to the various supported package indexes.

### Example: Workflow for Publishing to pypi.uoregon.edu

1. Follow instructions to [Deploy to pypi.uoregon.edu (confluence)](https://confluence.uoregon.edu/x/ag5aGw).
    * NOTE: This example assumes you are using our default SSH Key pair found in keepass: "General -> PKI Keys -> pypi.uoregon.edu"
    * That default key pair is saved as [a Secret named `PYPI_UOREGON_EDU_SSH_KEY` in Network-Services GitHub Organization](https://is-github.uoregon.edu/organizations/Network-Services/settings/secrets/actions)
2. Use workflow below to test and publish your python package at [pypi.uoregon.edu](https://pypi.uoregon.edu)

```yml
on:
  push:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on:
      - python
      - self-hosted
    steps:
      -
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      -
        name: Run automated tests
        uses: Network-Services/gh-actions-test-python-package@main

  deliver:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: test
    runs-on:
      - python
      - twine
      - python-build
      - self-hosted
    steps:
      -
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      -
        uses: Network-Services/gh-actions-deliver-python-package@main
        with:
          package-index: pypi.uoregon.edu
          pypi-ssh-key: ${{ secrets.PYPI_UOREGON_EDU_SSH_KEY }}
```

### Example: How to Publish to pypi.org using personal account

1. Log in to your pypi.org account
2. Generate an [API Token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken).
3. Save as "PYPI_API_TOKEN" in your GitHub Repository.
4. Copy the following GitHub Workflow to "./github/workflows/test-and-deliver.yml":

```

```

# Development (for Maintainers of gh-actions-deliver-python-package)

Notes for future developers to maintain this solution.

## 'package-for-testing-gh-actions'

To test if this is a useful python package on this project, first set up a 'virtual environment' ('.venv):

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the package in editable mode

```
pip install -e .
```
