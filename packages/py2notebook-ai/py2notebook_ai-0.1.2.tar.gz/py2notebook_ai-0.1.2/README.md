# Py2Notebook AI

[Py2Notebook AI](https://pypi.org/project/py2notebook-ai/0.1.0/) is a Python library that transforms Python scripts into Jupyter Notebooks. The tool leverages AI to generate insightful comments for each code block, helping to document and explain the code effectively.

## Features
- Converts Python scripts into Jupyter Notebook format.
- AI-generated comments for code blocks to improve understanding.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- Supports saving and managing OpenAI API keys.
- Allows overriding the saved API key for specific runs.

## Installation
Install Py2Notebook AI via pip:
```bash
pip install py2notebook-ai
```

## Usage
### 1. Configure OpenAI API Key
Before converting scripts, set your OpenAI API key using the following command:
```bash
py2notebook-ai config set-key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```
This will save your API key locally in a hidden configuration file.

### 2. Convert Python Script to Notebook
To convert a Python script to a Jupyter Notebook with AI-generated comments:
```bash
py2notebook-ai convert your_script.py -o output_notebook.ipynb
```
If you want to override the saved API key for a specific run:
```bash
py2notebook-ai convert your_script.py -o output_notebook.ipynb --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example
Input: `your_script.py`
```python
# your_script.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)
```

Output: `output_notebook.ipynb`
- A Jupyter Notebook with the code, comments explaining the `add` function, and the printed result.
