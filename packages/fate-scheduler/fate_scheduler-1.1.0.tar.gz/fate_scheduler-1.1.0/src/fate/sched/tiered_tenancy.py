class TieredTenancyScheduler(TaskScheduler):
    """Task scheduler grouping tasks' execution by configured "tenancy".

    The execution concurrency of tasks whose schedules coincide is
    limited. By default, tasks abide by a level of shared tenancy equal
    to a default value, which is a function of the CPU cores available
    to the execution environment. The level of shared tenancy which a
    task permits may be configured. (For example, a task requiring the
    exclusive use of all available CPUs, or a task requiring exclusive
    use of the network, might ensure that no other tasks execute
    concurrently, by configuring a scheduling tenancy of `1`.)

    The tiered tenancy scheduler queries the task schedule to collect a
    batch of scheduled tasks. This batch's lowest-tenancy tasks are
    executed first. As permitted by lower-tenancy tasks' configuration,
    tasks permitting higher tenancy *may* be executed concurrently.
    (For example: given a single task with a configured tenancy of `2`,
    one additional task *may* execute concurrently, so long as the batch
    contains additional tasks with configured tenancies of `2` or
    greater.) As a batch's lowest-tenancy tasks complete, the number of
    tasks which may execute concurrently is increased.

    During the course of task execution, should additional tasks become
    due, then subsequent batches of tasks are collected. Tasks collected
    from earlier batches -- also known as "cohorts" -- are prioritized
    over those of later batches. However, later-cohort tasks *may* be
    executed prior to earlier-cohort tasks, to ensure as many concurrent
    tasks are running as is permitted by the tenancy configurations of
    executing and to-be-executed tasks.
