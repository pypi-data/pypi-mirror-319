class TaskProcessPool:
    """A set-size, iterable collection of tasks launched for execution
    in subprocesses.

    A TaskProcessPool may be given any size, thereby setting the maximum
    number of "slots" for concurrently-executing subprocesses. And, an
    existing pool may be expanded via method `expand`; however, pools
    may not be shrunk.

    Slots may be occupied by launched (invoked) tasks in the form of
    ScheduledTasks. Upon construction (`__init__`) and expansion
    (`expand`), an iterable of unlaunched ScheduledTasks may be
    supplied, from which available slots will be filled, with the tasks,
    launched.

    Note that -- (unlike with construction of a list in the form
    `list(iterable)`) -- only as much of the given iterable is consumed
    as necessary to fill the pool's available slots.

    Method `iter_events` generates a stream of TaskEvents from the
    pool's slotted tasks, and removes tasks which have completed.
    Similar to the above, an iterable may be supplied of ScheduledTasks
    to be executed; these given tasks will "refill" slots emptied by
    completed tasks.

    Insofar as there are no tasks to execute, slots are occupied by
    `None`.
