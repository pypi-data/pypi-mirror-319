rust_nurbs
==========

Welcome to **rust_nurbs**, a Python API for evaluation of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) curves and surfaces implemented in Rust. The primary goals of this package are to allow for extremely fast NURBS evaluation while providing a user-friendly interface through Python with zero external dependencies.

Basic Installation
------------------

Installation is straightforward using the simple

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install rust-nurbs

.. note::

    The command ``pip install rust_nurbs`` also works. This underscore must be used when importing the library inside of Python because a hyphen in an import statement is not valid Python syntax.

If using the ``Stable`` version, the single ``pip install`` command should work for all major operating versions, CPU architectures, and versions of Python ``>=3.8``. See :ref:`install` for more detailed installation instructions if you have an unsupported architecture or are a developer and would like to extend or develop the library.

Quick Start
-----------

After installing **rust_nurbs** in the current environment and starting a Python console (or from inside a ``.py`` script), an example BÃ©zier surface with degree :math:`n=1` and :math:`m=3` can be evaluated at :math:`(u,v) = (0.3, 0.8)` using the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import rust_nurbs
    p = np.array([
        [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.3, 0.2, 0.0], [0.6, -0.1, 0.0], [1.2, 0.1, 0.0]], 
        [[0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [0.3, 0.4, 1.0], [0.6, -0.2, 1.0], [1.2, 0.2, 1.0]]
    ])
    surf_point = np.array(rust_nurbs.bezier_surf_eval(p, 0.3, 0.8))

If desired, all the functions listed in the :ref:`api` can be dumped to the current namespace to shorten the function names:

.. code-block:: python

    from rust_nurbs import *
    p = np.array([
        [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.3, 0.2, 0.0], [0.6, -0.1, 0.0], [1.2, 0.1, 0.0]], 
        [[0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [0.3, 0.4, 1.0], [0.6, -0.2, 1.0], [1.2, 0.2, 1.0]]
    ])
    surf_point = np.array(bezier_surf_eval(p, 0.3, 0.8))
