"""
Module for handling GeoJSON data related to building footprints and heights.

This module provides functionality for loading, filtering, transforming and saving GeoJSON data,
with a focus on building footprints and their height information. It includes functions for
coordinate transformations, spatial filtering, and height data extraction from various sources.
