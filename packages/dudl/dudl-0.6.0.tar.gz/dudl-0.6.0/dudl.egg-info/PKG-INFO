# DÜDL
Welcome to DÜDL! Here's how to get started:

## Option 1:

1. Install using `pip install dudl`.
2. Run with the `start-dudl` command.

## Option 2:

1. Download the files in this repository.
2. If you do not already have `pip` installed, download it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) first, then run `pip install -e .` to install all dependencies. Alternatively, you may install all dependencies manually. 
3. Run with the `start-dudl` command, or just `python3 dudl/dudl_app.py`.

Once the server is running, note the IP address that is printed out (http://192.168.1.15:8001) - that's what needs to be entered on your phone. Once all the server info has been entered, the `Connect and Continue` button on the app should light up green, and you should be ready to go! All your friends playing locally can join your server by entering the same server information.
