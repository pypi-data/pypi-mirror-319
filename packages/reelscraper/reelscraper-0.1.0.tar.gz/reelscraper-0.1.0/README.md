  Reel Scraper
  <br>
</h1>

<h4 align="center">
This Python project scrapes Instagram Reels from multiple accounts simultaneously, leveraging threading (and a dash of digital sorcery). It provides a convenient way to harvest Reels data without breaking a sweat—or Instagram's TOS (hopefully).

## 💻 Installation

Before you embark on your data-scraping journey, ensure that you have **Python 3.8+** installed on your system. If you don’t, please visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/multi-instagram-scraper.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**  
   ```bash
   cd multi-instagram-scraper
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   By the end of this step, you’re practically an Instagram-savvy wizard—just without the pointy hat.

## 🚀 Usage

Once you have all the dependencies installed, you’re ready to summon the scraper.

1. Make sure you have an `accounts.txt` file (or whichever file you’re using) with one Instagram username per line:
   ```
   user1
   user2
   user3
   ```
2. Run the scraper:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Or, if you prefer to live on the edge:
   ```bash
   python multi_insta_scraper.py
   ```
   The code will read your `accounts.txt`, quickly go spelunking in the Instagram mines, and return a lovely dictionary with each user’s Reels info.
