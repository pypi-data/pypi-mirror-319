      Prediction of absolute developmental potential <br> using  single-cell expression data
</p> </h2>

**CytoTRACE 2** is a computational method for predicting cellular potency categories and absolute developmental potential from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. 

Potency categories in the context of CytoTRACE 2 classify cells based on their developmental potential, ranging from totipotent and pluripotent cells with broad differentiation potential to lineage-restricted oligopotent, multipotent and unipotent cells capable of producing varying numbers of downstream cell types, and finally, differentiated cells, ranging from mature to terminally differentiated phenotypes.

The predicted potency scores additionally provide a continuous measure of developmental potential, ranging from 0 (differentiated) to 1 (totipotent).

Underlying this method is a novel, interpretable deep learning framework trained and validated across 34 human and mouse scRNA-seq datasets encompassing 28 tissue types, collectively spanning the developmental spectrum. 

This framework learns multivariate gene expression programs for each potency category and calibrates outputs across the full range of cellular ontogeny, facilitating direct cross-dataset comparison of developmental potential in an absolute space.

## Installation instructions

<details><summary>Expand section</summary>

Install using pip/pip3:

```bash
pip install cytotrace2-py
```

Some users face issues installing `datatable`. If this happens:  

1. Update GCC via Conda and reinstall:  
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64
   ```

2. Install via `pip` or `pip3`:  
   ```bash
   pip install datatable
   ```

These steps should resolve issues in most cases. Please ennsure Python is `>=3.9` and refer to the [datatable documentation](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/) if problems persist.

## Input files

<details><summary>Expand section</summary>

By default, CytoTRACE 2 requires only a single-cell gene expression file as input. For output plotting, a cell annotation file is accepted as well. All files should be provided in a tab-delimited tabular input format (.txt) with no double quotations. Further formatting details for each input file are specified below. 

__scRNA-seq gene expression file:__
- The table must be genes (rows) by cells (columns).
- The first row must contain the single cell IDs and the first column must contain the gene names.
- The gene expression data can be represented as raw or normalized counts, as long as normalization preserves relative ranking of input gene values within a cell.  
- No instances of duplicate gene or cell names should be present.

</p>

__Cell annotation file:__
- The table should contain two columns, where column 1 contains the single cell IDs corresponding to the columns of the scRNA-seq matrix and column 2 contains the corresponding cell type annotations.
- The columns must have a header. 
- Additional columns beyond the first two will be ignored.

## Running CytoTRACE 2 

<details><summary>Expand section</summary>

After installing the package and its dependencies, the tool is ready to run both from command line and from within a Python script.

For mouse data with default settings, CytoTRACE 2 would be run from command line as: 
 ```bash
 cytotrace2 \
    --input-path /path/to/cell_expression \
    --annotation-path /path/to/cell_annotations \
    --species mouse
```
Or with more condensed parameter names: 
 ```bash
 cytotrace2 \
    -f /path/to/cell_expression \
    -a /path/to/cell_annotations \
    -sp mouse
```

CytoTRACE 2 can also be called from within a Python script after importing the package.

 ```python
from cytotrace2_py.cytotrace2_py import *

input_path = "/path/to/cell_expression.txt"
example_annotation_path = "/path/to/cell_annotations.txt"
example_species = "human"

results =  cytotrace2(input_path,
                      annotation_path=example_annotation_path,
                      species=example_species)
 ```
</details>
