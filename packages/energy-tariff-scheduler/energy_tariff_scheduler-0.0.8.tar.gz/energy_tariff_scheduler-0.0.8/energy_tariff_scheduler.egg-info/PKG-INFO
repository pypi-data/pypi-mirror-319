## FAQ

> Do I need my account number?

Yes, you currently need your account number and API key for the Octopus tariffs, this is documented in the relevant tariff section <a href="https://craigwh10.github.io/energy-tariff-scheduler" target="_blank">Getting API key and Account number</a>.

This is only required to fetch your latest tariff code from Octopus as to match you with the correct product and get the prices for today.

> Why are no actions running between 11pm and 12am for Octopus Agile?

This is due to data availability, Octopus only provide pricing data from 12am-11:00pm.
