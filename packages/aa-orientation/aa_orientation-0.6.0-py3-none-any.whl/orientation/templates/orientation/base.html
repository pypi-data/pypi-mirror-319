        <p>This page lists all members who have joined EVE University in the past 31 days. Joining EVE University can be very overwhelming for new players, so we encourage our more experienced students to reach out to them to welcome them to EVE University and help them to find their way around.</p>

        <p>Rather than sending the same information to each new player, please try and reach out to them for an actual conversation, ideally in Discord. Make sure they know where to ask if they have any questions, how to access EVE University content and services and answer any questions they have. Be sure not to push a particular playstyle or opinion on new students, this is about introducing them to EVE University as a corporation.</p>

        <p>Once you have spoken to them please click 'Mark as Talked' so we know that someone has reached out to them and avoid duplication.</p>
