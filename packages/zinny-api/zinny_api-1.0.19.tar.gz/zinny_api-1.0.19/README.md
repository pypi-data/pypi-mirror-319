# Zinny API: A Backend Server for Structured Media Evaluations
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## What's the skinny on the cin√©?

Zinny API powers the backend for structured media evaluations using surveys from [zinny-surveys](https://github.com/RyLaney/zinny-surveys). It stores ratings in a SQLite database and provides endpoints for managing surveys, titles, ratings, and collections.

The API is used by the [zinny-webui](https://github.com/RyLaney/zinny-webui) frontend and the [zinny-cli](https://github.com/RyLaney/zinny-cli) command-line interface for seamless user interaction.


## Quickstart
1. Start the server:
  `python zinny-api.py` or `zinny-api`
2. Open the web browser to:
   `http://127.0.0.1:5219`
