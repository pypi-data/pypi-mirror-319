# Thunderstorm Event Reconnaissance (THUNER)

## Package description
Welcome to the Thunderstorm Event Reconnaissance (THUNER) package! 
THUNER is a flexible toolkit for multi-feature detection, tracking, tagging
and analysis of meteorological datasets. The intended application of 
the package is to the tracking and analysis of convective weather events. 
If you use this package in your work, consider citing the following papers;

- https://github.com/knubez/TAMS
- https://github.com/tobac-project/tobac
- https://github.com/AndreasPrein/MOAAP

When designing a tracking based research project involving THUNER, consider performing 
sensitivity tests using these competitors.
