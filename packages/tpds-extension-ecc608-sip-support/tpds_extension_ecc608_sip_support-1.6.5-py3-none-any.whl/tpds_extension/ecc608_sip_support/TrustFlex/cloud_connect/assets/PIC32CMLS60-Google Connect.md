# Trust Platform Design Suite - Usecase Help - Google Connect

This document helps to understand Pre and Post steps of Usecase transaction diagram.

## Setup requirements
 - [EV76R77A](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV76R77A)
 - [ATWINC1500-XPRO](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ATWINC1500-XPRO)
 - [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide) v6.00 or above

## Pre Usecase transaction Steps
 - Connect EV76R77A board to PC running Trust Platform Design Suite. It is required to connect both TARGET USB and DEBUG USB to PC.
 - ATWINC1500-XPRO should be connected to EXT3 of PIC32CMLS60 Curiosity PRO board
 - Ensure *MPLAB X Path* is set in *File* -> *Preference* under *System Settings*. This helps
    - To program the Usecase prototyping kit to factory reset application by TPDS
    - To open the embedded project of the Usecase
 - Setup GCP account. Follow the instructions at [**GCP demo account setup**](#gcp-account-setup-instructions)
 - Ensure *~/.trustplatform/gcp_credentials.yaml* contains the account credentials.
    - ~ indicates home directory.
        - Windows home directory is \user\username
        - Mac home directory is /users/username
        - Most Linux/Unix home directory is /home/username
 - Note that *~/.trustplatform/pic32cmls60_cloud_connect* is the **Usecase working directory**. It contains the resources generated during transaction diagram execution.
 - To update Winc Firmware on older versions of ATWINC1500-XPRO, please follow instructions [here](https://microchip-mplab-harmony.github.io/reference_apps/apps/sam_d21_iot/google_cloud_iot_core/utilities/readme.html)

## Post Usecase transaction Steps
On completing Usecase steps execution on TPDS, it is possible to either run the embedded project or view C source files by clicking *MPLAB X Project* or *C Source Folder* button.

- Once the Usecase project is loaded on MPLAB X IDE,
    - Set the project as Main -> right click on Project and select *Set as Main Project*
    - Set WiFi SSID and Password -> Open *cloud_wifi_config.h* under Project Header Files -> common -> cloud_wifi_config.h.
        - Uncomment and update WLAN_SSID and WLAN_PSK macros with user's wifi SSID and password
    - Set the configuration -> right click on Project, expand *Set Configuration* to select *GOOGLE_CONNECT*
    - Build and Program the project -> right click on Project and select *Make and Program Device*
- Log from the embedded project can be viewed using applications like TeraTerm. Select the COM port and set baud rate as 115200-8-N-1

Example TeraTerm log after successfully executing embedded project:

- Connecting to Cloud messages appear along with the led state.

## GCP Account Setup Instructions
This document mainly focuses on how-to setup the google cloud account For connecting the trust platform devices to cloud.

### Setting up Google Cloud account1.
1. Log into the [Google Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/start?tutorial=iot_core_quickstart)
2. Use your personal Gmail account to log in. Select **Try for free**.
**Note:** If not, create a new email account from [HERE](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&amp;flowName=GlifWebSignIn&amp;flowEntry=SignUp)
3. Create a new Google cloud project with the name – gcp-trust-demo by clicking the **Select a project**, **NEW PROJECT** and **Create**

    ![Select Project](images/gcp/select_project.png "Select Project")

    ![New Project](images/gcp/new_project.png "New Project")

    ![Create Project](images/gcp/create_project.png "Create Project")

4. Select organization if available or just select No organization
5. Once the project is created, the home page looks like the screen shot below
**Note:** Note down the Project Id which will be used later.

    ![Project Info](images/gcp/project_info.png "Project Info")


6. In the search bar, type **billing** to get to the billing page. It is necessary to do it during this step, as without credit card information, the IoT Core cannot be accessed. Click Link a billing account to add the credit card information. Follow the prompts to complete the billing information.
