# num2alpha

## Description

This Python script converts any base-10 integer into its "alphabetical number" counterpart. For example, `1` is `a`, `26` is `z`, and `28` is `ab`. This alphabetical number order is exactly what you find in the column name of most modern spreadsheet apps.

This script can also decode an alphabetical number and return its integer order in base-10. For instance, the spreadsheet column `AXY` is counted as the `1325`-th column of the spreadsheed, and the string `helloworld` equals to `44580442473324`.

## Installation

`num2alpha` is available for download through Python Package Index (PyPI). Run the following command in your operating system via the terminal:

```sh
python -m pip install num2alpha
