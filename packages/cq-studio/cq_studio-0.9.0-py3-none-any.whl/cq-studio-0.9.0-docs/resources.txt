Website / documentation
-----------------------

The project's documentation and website, such as it is, is hosted at
https://pyropus.ca/docs/cq-studio/.

Repository

Mailing List
------------

I typically have mailing lists for my projects that are used by others.  If
there is interest in ``cq-studio`` I may create one.

Contact
-------

If you need to contact me personally, you can email me at
``charlesc-software-cqs`` *at* ``pyropus.ca``.  Please note that I probably
won't be able to spend much time on private technical support - that's why I
normally have mailing lists and archives, so that those resources are available
to other users in the future.
