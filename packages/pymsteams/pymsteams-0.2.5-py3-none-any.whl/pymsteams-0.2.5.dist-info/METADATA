              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pymsteams.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pymsteams)

Python Wrapper Library to send requests to Microsoft Teams Webhooks.
Microsoft refers to these messages as Connector Cards.  A message can be sent with only the main Connector Card, or additional sections can be included into the message.

This library uses Webhook Connectors for Microsoft Teams.  Please visit the following Microsoft Documentation link for instructions on how to obtain the correct url for your Channel: https://dev.outlook.com/Connectors/GetStarted#creating-messages-through-office-365-connectors-in-microsoft-teams

Please refer to the Microsoft Documentation for the most up to date screenshots.
https://dev.outlook.com/connectors/reference

## Installation

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install pymsteams
```

Install with async capabilities (python 3.6+):

```bash
pip install pymsteams[async]
```

#### Python 2 Installation

At time of writing, the latest release supported by Python 2 is [Version 0.1.16](https://github.com/rveachkc/pymsteams/releases/tag/0.1.16)

## Usage

### Creating ConnectorCard Messages

This is the simplest implementation of pymsteams.  It will send a message to the teams webhook url with plain text in the message.

```python
import pymsteams

# You must create the connectorcard object with the Microsoft Webhook URL
myTeamsMessage = pymsteams.connectorcard("<Microsoft Webhook URL>")

# Add text to the message.
myTeamsMessage.text("this is my text")

# send the message.
myTeamsMessage.send()
```

### Creating CreatorCard Messages to send via async loop

```python
import asyncio
import pymsteams

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

# the async_connectorcard object is used instead of the normal one.
myTeamsMessage = pymsteams.async_connectorcard("<Microsoft Webhook URL>")

# all formatting for the message should be the same
myTeamsMessage.text("This is my message")

# to send the message, pass to the event loop
loop.run_until_complete(myTeamsMessage.send())
```

Please visit the python asyncio documentation for more info on using asyncio and the event loop: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html


### Optional Formatting Methods for Cards

#### Add a title
```python
myTeamsMessage.title("This is my message title")
```

#### Add a link button
```python
myTeamsMessage.addLinkButton("This is the button Text", "https://github.com/rveachkc/pymsteams/")
```

#### Change URL
This is useful in the event you need to post the same message to multiple rooms.
```python
myTeamsMessage.newhookurl("<My New URL>")
```

#### Set Color Theme
This sets the theme color of the card. The parameter is expected to be a hex color code without the hash or the string red.
```python
myTeamsMessage.color("<Hex Color Code>")
```

#### Preview your object
This is a simple print command to view your connector card message object before sending.
```python
myTeamsMessage.printme()
```

### Adding sections to the Connector Card Message
To create a section and add various formatting elements
```python
# create the section
myMessageSection = pymsteams.cardsection()

# Section Title
myMessageSection.title("Section title")

# Activity Elements
myMessageSection.activityTitle("my activity title")
myMessageSection.activitySubtitle("my activity subtitle")
myMessageSection.activityImage("http://i.imgur.com/c4jt321l.png")
myMessageSection.activityText("This is my activity Text")

# Facts are key value pairs displayed in a list.
myMessageSection.addFact("this", "is fine")
myMessageSection.addFact("this is", "also fine")

# Section Text
myMessageSection.text("This is my section text")

# Section Images
myMessageSection.addImage("http://i.imgur.com/c4jt321l.png", ititle="This Is Fine")

# Add your section to the connector card object before sending
myTeamsMessage.addSection(myMessageSection)
```
You may also add multiple sections to a connector card message as well.
```python
# Create Section 1
Section1 = pymsteams.cardsection()
Section1.text("My First Section")

# Create Section 2
Section2 = pymsteams.cardsection()
Section2.text("My Second Section")

# Add both Sections to the main card object
myTeamsMessage.addSection(Section1)
myTeamsMessage.addSection(Section2)

# Then send the card
myTeamsMessage.send()
```
### Adding potential actions to the Connector Card Message
To create a actions on which the user can interect with in MS Teams
To find out more information on what actions can be used, please visit https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/connectors/connectors-using#setting-up-a-custom-incoming-webhook

```python
myTeamsMessage = pymsteams.connectorcard("<Microsoft Webhook URL>")

myTeamsPotentialAction1 = pymsteams.potentialaction(_name = "Add a comment")
myTeamsPotentialAction1.addInput("TextInput","comment","Add a comment here",False)
myTeamsPotentialAction1.addAction("HttpPost","Add Comment","https://...")

myTeamsPotentialAction2 = pymsteams.potentialaction(_name = "Set due date")
myTeamsPotentialAction2.addInput("DateInput","dueDate","Enter due date")
myTeamsPotentialAction2.addAction("HttpPost","save","https://...")

myTeamsPotentialAction3 = pymsteams.potentialaction(_name = "Change Status")
myTeamsPotentialAction3.choices.addChoices("In progress","0")
myTeamsPotentialAction3.choices.addChoices("Active","1")
myTeamsPotentialAction3.addInput("MultichoiceInput","list","Select a status",False)
myTeamsPotentialAction3.addAction("HttpPost","Save","https://...")

myTeamsMessage.addPotentialAction(myTeamsPotentialAction1)
myTeamsMessage.addPotentialAction(myTeamsPotentialAction2)
myTeamsMessage.addPotentialAction(myTeamsPotentialAction3)

myTeamsMessage.summary("Test Message")

myTeamsMessage.send()
```
### Adding HTTP Post to potential actions in the Connector Card Message

```python
myTeamsMessage = pymsteams.connectorcard("<Microsoft Webhook URL>")

myTeamsPotentialAction1 = pymsteams.potentialaction(_name = "Add a comment")
# You can add a TextInput to your potential action like below - Please note the 2nd argment below as the id name
myTeamsPotentialAction1.addInput("TextInput","comment","Add a comment here",False)
# we use the 2nd argument above as the id name to parse the values into the body post like below.
myTeamsPotentialAction1.addAction("HttpPost","Add Comment","https://...", "{{comment.value}}")
myTeamsMessage.addPotentialAction(myTeamsPotentialAction1)


myTeamsMessage.summary("Test Message")

myTeamsMessage.send()

# Notes:
# If you post anything via teams, you will get some Javascript encoding happening via the post - For example:
# Posting this:  {"name":"john", "comment" : "nice"}
# Output will be:  b'{\\u0022name\\u0022:\\u0022john\\u0022, \\u0022comment\\u0022 : \\u0022nice\\u0022}'
# i solved this issue by decoding unicode escape for a custom rest backend.
```

Please use Github issues to report any bugs or request enhancements.

## Troubleshooting HTTP response

This module is really just a nice wrapper pointed at the Microsoft API. To help troubleshoot missing messages, the requests response content is saved to the connectorcard class attribute `last_http_response`.

To get the last http status code:
```python
import pymsteams

myTeamsMessage = pymsteams.connectorcard("<Microsoft Webhook URL>")
myTeamsMessage.text("this is my text")
myTeamsMessage.send()

last_status_code = myTeamsMessage.last_http_response.status_code
```

More info on the Response Content is available in the requests documentation, [link](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#response-content).

## Exceptions

If the call to the Microsoft Teams webhook service fails, a `TeamsWebhookException` will be thrown.

## Testing

In order to test in your environment with pytest, set the environment variable `MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK` to the Microsoft Teams Webhook url you would like to use.

Then, from the root of the repo, install the requirements and run pytest.

```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK=MicrosoftWebhookURL
export MS_TEAMS_WEBHOOK
pytest --cov=./pymsteams --cov-report=term-missing --cov-branch
```

This will send two MS Teams messages describing how they are formatted.  Manually validate that the message comes through as expected.

## Certificate Validation

In some situations, a custom CA bundle must be used.  This can be set on class initialization, by setting the verify parameter.

```python
import pymsteams

# set custom ca bundle
msg = pymsteams.connectorcard("<Microsoft Webhook URL>", verify="/path/to/file")

# disable CA validation
msg = pymsteams.connectorcard("<Microsoft Webhook URL>", verify=False)
```

Set to either the path of a custom CA bundle or False to disable.

The requests documentation can be referenced for full details: https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification
