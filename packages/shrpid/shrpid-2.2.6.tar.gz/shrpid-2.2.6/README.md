> **Note**
>
> The description below applies to the current version 2 of SH-RPi. Version 2 is available for purchase at <a href="https://hatlabs.fi/"><b>hatlabs.fi</b></a>. The installation script also supports version 1 of SH-RPi even though most of the documentation below is for version 2.


## Introduction

[SH-RPi](https://shop.hatlabs.fi/products/sh-rpi), formally known as Sailor Hat for Raspberry Pi,
is a Raspberry Pi smart power management board. The main features are:

- Power management with a 60 Farad supercapacitor that provides so-called last gasp energy for shutting down the device in a controlled fashion after the system power is cut.
- Peak power management: The same supercapacitor circuitry is able to provide peak current for power-hungry devices such as the Raspberry Pi 4B with SSD or NVMe drives, allowing those devices to be powered using current-limited subcircuits such as the NMEA2000 bus power wires.
- Protection circuitry: The board is protected against noisy 12V/24V voltages commonly present on vehicles or marine vessels.
- A battery-powered real-time clock circuit, allowing for the device to keep time even in the absence of GPS or networking.

`shrpid` is a power monitor and watchdog for the SH-RPi. It communicates with the SH-RPi device, providing the "smart" aspects of the operation. Supported features include:

- Blackout reporting if input voltage falls below a defined threshold
- Triggering of device shutdown if power isn't restored
- Supercap voltage reporting
- Watchdog functionality: if the SH-RPi receives no communication for 10 seconds, the SH-RPi will hard reset the device.
- RTC sleep mode: the onboard real-time clock can be set to boot the Raspberry Pi at a specific time. This is useful for battery powered devices that should perform scheduled tasks such as boat battery and bilge level monitoring.

The main use case for the service software is to have the Raspberry Pi shut down once the power is cut. This prevents potential file system corruption without having to shut down the device manually.

## Installation

Copy and paste the following lines to your terminal to install the latest version of the daemon and to update the configuration files:

    curl -L \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hatlabs/SH-RPi-daemon/main/install-online.sh \
        | sudo bash

### Installing from an online branch

If you want to install the daemon from a specific branch, you can use the following command:

    curl -L \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hatlabs/SH-RPi-daemon/BRANCH/install-online.sh \
        | sudo bash -s -- https://github.com/hatlabs/SH-RPi-daemon BRANCH

Replace `BRANCH` with the desired branch name. Note that the BRANCH needs to be specified twice in the command.

### Using Docker

If you prefer to use Docker to run the daemon, you can clone the repo and issue the following commands:

    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build
    docker compose -d -f docker/docker-compose.yml up

If you have previously installed the daemon using the `install-online.sh` script, you need to stop and disable the daemon on your system by issuing the following command:

    sudo systemctl disable --now shrpid

Before starting the Docker container, you need to manually enable I2C on your Raspberry Pi by issuing the following command:

    sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0

### Unattended Installation

Alternatively, it is possible to clone this repo on a Raspberry Pi device and run the `install.sh` script. This will install the daemon and the configuration files. If you want to define the desired configuration without going through the interactive dialogs, they can be defined on the command line as follows:

    sudo ./install.sh --enable RTC,CAN

The above command will enable the RTC and CAN (NMEA 2000) features. The following features are available:

- `RTC`: Enables the real-time-clock
- `CAN`: Enables the CAN (NMEA 2000) interface
- `RS485`: Enables the RS485 interface
- `MAX-M8Q`: Enables the u-blox MAX-M8Q GPS interface

## Configuration

The `shrpid` daemon can be configured using a configuration file.
The default configuration file location is `/etc/shrpid.conf`.
Note that no configuration file is created by default.
Instead, you need to create one at the given location.
The configuration file is in YAML format.
The configuration keys are the same as daemon command line arguments that can be seen by issuing the following command:

    shrpid --help

For example, if you want to change the blackout time limit to 10 seconds andthe poweroff command to `/home/pi/bin/custom-poweroff`, you can edit the configuration file as follows:

    blackout-time-limit: 10
    poweroff: /home/pi/bin/custom-poweroff

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Instructions

See the `run` script for common development tasks. The instructions below are for a generic `poetry` project.

### Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish üôÇ `poetry publish --build`

### Development features

- Supports for `Python 3.9` and higher.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as the dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/pyproject.toml) and [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/setup.cfg).
- Automatic codestyle with [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade).
- Ready-to-use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks with code-formatting.
- Type checks with [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io); docstring checks with [`darglint`](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint); security checks with [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
- Testing with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
- Ready-to-use [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/.editorconfig), [`.dockerignore`](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/.dockerignore), and [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/.gitignore). You don't have to worry about those things.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U shrpid
```

or install with `Poetry`

```bash
poetry add shrpid
```

## Using with Conda

Conda users can setup a development environtment with ideas [stolen from Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71110028/2999754).

```bash
conda create --name shrpid --file conda-linux-64.lock
conda activate shrpid
poetry install
```

and during regular use:

```bash
conda activate shrpid
```

Conda environment can be updated as follows:

```bash
# Re-generate Conda lock file(s) based on environment.yml
conda-lock -k explicit --conda mamba
# Update Conda packages based on re-generated lock file
mamba update --file conda-linux-64.lock
# Update Poetry packages and re-generate poetry.lock
poetry update
```

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/hatlabs/shrpid/blob/master/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Download and remove Poetry</summary>
<p>

To download and install Poetry run:

```bash
make poetry-download
```

To uninstall

```bash
make poetry-remove
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Codestyle</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `pyupgrade`, `isort` and `black`.

```bash
make codestyle

# or use synonym
make formatting
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `isort`, `black` and `darglint` library

Update all dev libraries to the latest version using one comand

```bash
make update-dev-deps
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Code security</summary>
<p>
