Python package to filter a list of dictionaries based on their contents.

```python
from py_dictfind import find

data = [
    {
        "foo": 1,
        "bar": "hello",
        "baz": {"a": 100, "b": 200}
    },
    {
        "foo": 2,
        "baz": {"b": 200}
    },
    {
        "foo": 3
    }
]

# get all dictionaries containing key `foo`
result = find(data, "foo")

# get all dictionaries that contain both the `foo` and `baz` keys
result = find(data, "foo and baz")

# get all dictionaries where `foo` is equal to 2
result = find(data, "foo == 2")

# get all dictionaries for which the nested `b` key inside `baz` is 200
result = find(data, "baz.b == 200")

# make the expression as complex as needed
result = find(data, 'not (foo > 3 and baz) or (bar == "hello" and baz.a)')
```

## Description

py-dictfind allows you to check dictionaries to see if they contain certain keys or if their values
match specific ones. To do that, it provides two functions: `find` and `check`.

`find(dictionaries: list[dict], condition: str): list[dict]`

`find` returns all the dictionaries in `dictionaries` that match the provided `condition`.
The condition is provided as a string. The condition syntax is detailed in the next section.

`check(dictionary: dict, condition: str): bool`

`check` returns if a single dict matches the provided condition or not,
returning `True` or `False` consequently.

You can import both functions with:
```python
from py_dictfind import find, check
```

This package can be useful for applications that need to provide users with a
very simple syntax to express conditions in JSON or YAML configuration files.

A made up example:

```yaml
environment: "dev"   # one of "prod", "stage", "dev"
clear-cache-if: "environment != 'prod'"
```

And then, when your application reads the configuration, it can set some values by evaluating itself:

```python
config["clear-cache"] = check(config, config["clear-cache-if"])
```

## Syntax

*Basic clauses*

You can reference dictionary keys using backtick strings:

    `foo`

A lone key reference checks for its presence in the dictionary:

    check({"foo": 1}, "`foo`")  # True

The only restriction for keys is that they need to be strings. However, they can be as complex as necessary:

    `A more complex key with spaces`

For simple keys that only use letters, numbers and underscores, you can omit the backticks:

    foo

You can reference nested keys using dot notation:

    foo.bar.baz

Keys with spaces of special characters are just referenced with backticks in this case too:

    foo.`A more complex key with spaces`

For example:

    check({"foo": {"a key": 1}}, "foo.`a key`")  # True

You can use the `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `<` and `>` operators to check the values of keys:

    foo == "hello"

Values can be:

* Strings (with either single or double quotes): `"hello"`, `'hello'`.
* Integers: `1`, `5`, `200`
* Decimal numbers: `1.5`, `40.0`
* Boolean values (they are case insensitive): `true`, `True`, `TRUE`, `false`, `False`, `FALSE`


**Note!**: Make sure to surround string literals with either single or double quotes.
Not using quotes for string values results in a syntax error.

To check for equality, you can also use `:` which works exactly the same as `==`:

    author: "Jane"

There's also an additional operator `~=` to match the key value against a regular expression:

    author ~= "^J.*$"

*Combined clauses*

You can combine basic clauses using the boolean operators `and`, `or` and
`not`. It is also possible to use parenthesis to make clear their precedence:

    foo == "hello" and bar > 3
    not (foo == "hello" and bar > 3) or (baz != "bye")


## Limitations and Alternatives

* py-dictfind can only work with string keys (like in JSON).
* It just retrieves complete dictionaries. It doesn't select specific fields to return or internal structures.

py-dictfind has been created with the objective of providing a very easy query
syntax. If you need something more powerful (with an arguably more complex
syntax too), [JSONPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONPath) can be a better fit.
