    Compute log-determinant under memory constraint.

    Parameters
    ----------

    A : numpy.ndarray, numpy.memmap, zarr.core.Array, dask.array,\
            tensotstore.array
        Square matrix, which is either already loaded on the memory (such as
        ``numpy.ndarray``), or cannot fit on the memory, and rather, stored on
        disk as Numpy's memory map, or Zarr, Dask, or TensorStore array
        formats.

    max_mem : float or str, default= ``float('inf')``
        The maximum memory allowed to be allocated during the computation.
        This can be specified as an integer representing the number of bytes,
        or as a string such as ``16.2GB`` (a number immediately followed by
        the unit of memory such as ``B``, ``KB``, ``MB``, ``GB``, ``TB``, etc).

        The default value of ``float('inf')`` indicates infinite amount of
        memory is available, hence, no memory is constrained. This case falls
        back to conventional computation of log-determinant on memory without
        creation of any scratchpad space on disk.

        .. note::

            To constrain memory, you can either set ``max_mem`` or directly set
            the number of matrix blocks (see ``num_blocks`` option). If
            ``max_mem`` is set, ``num_block`` option is ignored.

    num_blocks : int, default=1
        Number of memory blocks along rows and columns. This is used when
        the whole matrix cannot be loaded on the memory, rather, smaller
        blocks of the matrix are loaded on the memory.

        * If `=1`:  the whole matrix is loaded to memory as one block. No
          scratchpad disk space is needed as all data is on memory.
        * If `=2`:  matrix is decomposed to 2 by 2 memory blocks (four blocks),
          but three of these blocks will be loaded concurrently to memory. No
          scratchpad disk space is needed.
        * If `>2`: matrix is decomposed to a grid of (``num_blocks``,
          ``num_blocks``) blocks, but only `4` of these blocks will be loaded
          concurrently. Scratchpad disk space will be created (see
          ``scratch_dir`` option).

        The number of blocks  may or may not be a divisor of the matrix size.
        If the number of blocks is not a divisor of the matrix size, the blocks
        on the last row-block and column-block will have smaller size.

        .. note::

            To constrain memory, you can either set ``num_blocks`` or directly
            set the amount of memory limit (see ``max_mem`` option). If
            ``max_mem`` is set, the given ``num_block`` option by the user is
            ignored, and instead computed automatically.

    triangle : ``'l'``, ``'u'``, or None, default=None
        When the  matrix is symmetric, this option indicates whether the full
        matrix is stored or only a triangular part of the matrix is given:

        * ``'l'``: assumes the lower-triangular part of the matrix is given.
        * ``'u'``: assumes the upper-triangular part of the matrix is given.
        * ``None``: indicates full matrix is given.

    assume : str {``'gen'``, ``'sym'``, ``'spd'``}, default= ``'gen'``
        Assumption on the input matrix `A`:

        * ``'gen'``: generic square matrix
        * ``'sym'``: symmetric matrix
        * ``'spd'``: symmetric positive-definite matrix

        The assumption on the matrix is not checked.

    mixed_precision : str {``'float32'``, ``'float64'``}, or numpy.dtype,\
            default= ``'float64'``
        The precision at which the computations are performed. This may be
        different than the data type of the input matrix. It is recommended
        to set a precision equal or higher than the *dtype* of the input
        matrix. For instance, if the input matrix has ``float32`` data type,
        you may set this option to ``float64``.

    parallel_io : str {``'multiproc'``, ``'dask'``, ``'tensorstore'``} or\
            None, default=None
        Parallel data transfer (load and store operations of each block) from
        memory to scratchpad on the disk and vice-versa:

        * ``'multiproc'``: utilizes Python's built-in multiprocessing.
        * ``'dask'``: utilizes Dask's multiprocessing. For this to work,
          the package `dask <https://www.dask.org/>`__ should be installed.
        * ``'tensorstore'``: utilizes TensorStore's multiprocessing. For this
          to work, the packages
          `tensorstore <https://google.github.io/tensorstore/>`__ and
          `zarr <https://zarr.readthedocs.io/>`__ should be installed.
        * ``None``: no parallel processing is performed. All data transfer is
          performed on a single CPU thread.

        .. note::

            The option ``'tensorstore'`` can only be used when the input matrix
            `A` is a `zarr` array. See `zarr <https://zarr.readthedocs.io/>`__
            package.

    scratch_dir : str, default=None
        When ``num_blocks`` is greater than `2`, the computations are performed
        on a scratchpad space on disk. This option determines the directory
        where memdet should create a temporary scratch file. If ``None``, the
        default OS's tmp directory will be used. For instance, in UNIX, this is
        almost always ``'/tmp'`` directory.

        .. note::

            This directory should have enough space as much as the size of the
            input matrix (or half of the input matrix size if ``triangle``
            option is set).

    overwrite : boolean, default=True
        Uses the input matrix storage for intermediate computations.
        This will overwrite the input matrix.

    return_info : bool, default=False
        Returns a dictionary containing profiling information such as wall and
        process times, memory allocation, disk usage, etc. See ``info``
        variable in the return section below.

    verbose : bool, default=False
        Prints verbose output during computation.

    Returns
    -------

    ld : float
        :math:`\\mathrm{logabsdet}(\\mathbf{A})`, which is the natural
        logarithm of the absolute value of the determinant of the input matrix.
    sign : int
        Sign of determinant
    diag : numpy.array
        An array of the size of the number rows (or columns) of the matrix,
        containing the diagonal elements of the matrix decomposition as
        follows:

        * For genetic matrix (when ``assume='gen'``), this is the diagonal
          entries of the matrix :math:`\\mathbf{U}` in the LU decomposition
          :math:`\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{U}`.
        * For symmetric matrix (when ``assume='sym'``), this is the diagonal
          entries of the matrix :math:`\\mathbf{D}` in the LDL decomposition
          :math:`\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{U}^{\\intercal}
          \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{U}` where :math:`\\mathbf{U}` is
          upper-triangular.
        * For symmetric positive-definite matrix (when ``assume='spd'``), this
          is the diagonal entries of the matrix :math:`\\mathbf{L}` in the
          Cholesky decomposition :math:`\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{U}^{\\intercal}
          \\mathbf{U}` where :math:`\\mathbf{U}` is upper-triangular.

            * ``'matrix'``: info about input matrix
                * ``'dtype'``: the data type of the input matrix.
                * ``'matrix_shape'``: shape of the input matrix.
                * ``'triangle'``: in case of symmetric matrix, whether upper
                  or lower triangle part of matrix is given (based on
                  ``triangle`` option).
                * ``'assume'``: whether matrix is generic, symmetric, or
                  symmetric and positive-definite (based on ``assume`` option).
            * ``'process'``: info about the computation process and profiling

                * ``'load_wall_time'``: wall time for only the load operation,
                  which is the data transfer from disk to memory. This is
                  relevant only if scratchpad space was used during the
                  computation.
                * ``'load_proc_time'``: process time of all CPU threads for
                  only the load operation, which is the data transfer from disk
                  to memory. This is relevant only if scratchpad space was
                  used during the computation.
                * ``'store_wall_time'``: wall time for only the store
                  operation, which is the data transfer from memory to disk.
                  This is relevant only if scratchpad space was used during the

                * ``'store_proc_time'``: process time of all CPU threads for
                  only the store operation, which is the data transfer from

                  column-block) is not a divisor of the matrix size, some
                  blocks may be smaller, however, this quantity reports the

                  When the number of blocks along row-block (or column-block)
                  is not a divisor of the matrix size, some blocks may be

                * ``'io_chunk'``: the size of data chunks for for input/output
                  data transfer operations between disk and memory. This size

                * ``'num_scratch_blocks'``: number of blocks stored to the
                  scratchpad space. Note that not all memory blocks are

                  ``num_blocks * num_blocks``.
                * ``'scratch_file'``: the scratch file that was created, and
                  later deleted after termination of the algorithm. This file

                * ``'total_mem'``: total memory allocated in bytes divided by
                  ``mem_unit``. This includes the memory of blocks and any
                  extra memory required by the algorithm.

                  (row-major) ordering or ``F`` for Fortran (column-major)
                  ordering during computation.

    Notes
    -----

    **How to Limit Memory Usage:**

    If the whole matrix cannot be loaded on the memory, this function chunks
    the matrix into smaller sub-matrices (blocks) and load three or four of
    these blocks concurrently to the memory.

    For instance, if your matrix size is 100 GB, and your machine has 16 GB
    memory, you may need a grid of 5 by 5 blocks (25 blocks), each having
    100 GB / 25 = 4 GB in size. Four of these blocks take 16 GB, which can fit
    your machine's memory.

    There are two ways to set the memory limit:

    * either directly, by setting ``max_mem`` argument (such as ``16GB`` in the
      above example),
    * or indirectly, by setting ``num_blocks`` argument (such as 5 in the
      above example).

    You only need to set one of these arguments, but not both. However, if you
    set ``max_mem``, the argument ``num_blocks`` is ignored, and rather,
    recalculated from ``max_mem``.

    **What is Scratch:**

    When ``num_blocks`` is 1 or 2 (a grid of 1x1 or 2x2 blocks), all
    calculations are performed on the memory, even if the whole input matrix
    cannot be fit on the memory (in case of 2x2 blocks)!

    However, for larger number of blocks (when ``num_blocks`` is greater than
    2), this function creates a temporary space on your disk to store
    the variables during the inner computations. This space (called scratchpad)
    is a hidden file created in the ``scratch_dir`` directory, and will be
    automatically removed once this function returns.

    If you do not specify ``scratch_dir``, the *tmp* directory in your
    operating system (such as ``/tmp`` in UNIX) will be used.

    **What is Parallel IO:**

    This function reads and writes to the scratchpad on your disk. For very
    large matrices (and hence, very large blocks) the read/write operations
    (io operations) can be time consuming. You can leverage the ``parallel_io``
    argument to let all CPU threads performing these tasks in parallel.
    However, note that, depending on your hardware, your disk may throttle
    parallel file operations.

    **Using Dask:**

    When using Dask (either if the input array ``A`` is a Dask array or when
    ``parallel_io='dask'``), you should call :func:`detkit.memdet` function in
    a protected *if-clause*. See further details at
    `multiprocessing-error-without-if-clause-protection
    <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/windows.html>`__.

    **The "diag" Output Variable:**

    In addition to the log-abs-determinant (``ld``) and sign of determinant
    (``sign``) variables, this function also returns the ``diag`` variable.
    The variable ``diag`` is a 1D array of size `n` (the number of rows or
    columns of ``A``), and can be used to compute the log-abs-determinant of
    any sub-matrix ``A[:m, :m]``, all at once, where ``m`` can be 1 to `n`.
    If we denote the sub-matrix ``A[:m, :m]`` as :math:`\\mathbf{A}_{[:m, :m]}`
    and the element ``diag[i]`` as :math:`d_i`, we have:

    * For generic and symmetric matrices (if ``assume`` is set to ``'gen'`` or
      ``'sym'``):

      .. math::

          \\log \\vert \\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}_{[:m, :m]}) \\vert =
          \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\log \\vert d_i \\vert.

    * For symmetric and positive-definite matrices (if ``assume`` is set to
      ``'spd'``):

      .. math::

          \\log \\vert \\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}_{[:m, :m]}) \\vert =
          2 \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\log \\vert d_i \\vert.

    In particular, the output variable ``ld`` is computed from ``diag`` when
    :math:`m = n`.

    Note that computing ``diag`` is a by-product for free and does not require
    any additional cost.

        >>> z = zarr.open(z_path, mode='w', shape=(n, n), dtype=A.dtype)

    By setting ``verbose=True``, a detailed log is printed during the
    computation, as shown in the screenshot below.

    The above logs illustrate how the matrix is processed. For example, due to
    the memory limit of 500 MB, a matrix of size 762.9 MB is decomposed into
    smaller blocks (a grid of 3 by 3 blocks), where each block is 84.8 MB. At
    any time, only four of these blocks are concurrently loaded into memory:
    blocks A11, A12, A21, and A22. The allocated size of each block is shown.

    In the above, the computation was performed in 7 steps. The number of steps
    vary depending the number of blocks. Each step may involve:

    - Loading a block from disk to memory (`loading blk`)
    - Storing a block from memory back to disk (`storing blk`)
    - Performing LU, LDL, or Cholesky decomposition (e.g. `ldl decompo`)
    - Solving an upper triangular system of equations (`solve uptri`)
    - Solving a lower triangular system of equations (`solve lotri`)
    - Computing the Schur complement (`schur compl`)

    For each task, the proceeding columns in the verbose prints are as follows:

    - *time*: CPU process time
    - *cpu*: CPU utilization percentage (for all CPU threads combined)
    - *alloc*: Peak memory allocation during the task
    - *read*: Data read from scratchpad on disk
    - *write*: Data written to scratchpad on disk

    Note that an efficient implementation should not allocate any new memory
    during any of the above tasks during the computation. The only memory
    allocation should be the creation of the blocks at the beginning. As seen
    in the screenshot above, all memory allocations (on the order of KB) are
    negligible compared to the size of a block (on the order of MB), indicating
    that no new array is created.

    The above code also returns the ``info`` variable by setting
    ``return_info=True``. Here is a pretty-print of ``info`` dictionary:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> # Print info results
        >>> from pprint import pprint
        >>> pprint(info)

    which gives the following output:
