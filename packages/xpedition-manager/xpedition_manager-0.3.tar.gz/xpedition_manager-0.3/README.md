# Xpedition Manager

`xpedition_manager` is a Python package that sets up the Xpedition Designer and PCB layout environment more easily and quickly. This package helps automate your Xpedition environment and integrates with related applications.

## Prerequisites

Before using `xpedition_manager`, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

- **Xpedition Application**: Xpedition PCB and/or Designer application must be installed on your machine.
- **License**: A valid license for Xpedition is required to run this package.

## Installing Guide

install xpedition-manager using pip
```bash
pip install xpedition-manager
```
## Examples
### 1. Import and reference the XpeditionManager
To use the `XpeditionManager`, simply import it and initialize the environment as needed.
```python
from xpedition_manager import XpeditionManager

# Create an instance of the XpeditionManager
manager = XpeditionManager()

# If you want to set up the Xpedition Designer environment:
manager.initialize_design()

# If you want to set up the Xpedition PCB layout environment:
manager.initialize_pcb()

# If you want to set up both the Xpedition both Designer and PCB layout environments:
manager.initialize_design_and_pcb()
```

### 2. Inherit xpedition-manager (for PCB)
The following example demonstrates how to extend the XpeditionManager class to add custom functionality:
```python
from xpedition_manager import XpeditionManager

class ExtendedXpeditionManager(XpeditionManager):
    def __init__(self):
        XpeditionManager.__init__(self) 
        self.initialize_pcb() # When this line is executed, self.pcb_app and self.pcb_doc are determined.

    def get_selected_nets(self):
        selected_nets_com = self.pcb_doc.GetNets(1)
        return selected_nets_com

    def get_current_unit(self):
        current_unit = self.pcb_doc.CurrentUnit
        if current_unit == 2:
            return "mils"
        elif current_unit == 3:
            return "inch"
        elif current_unit == 4:
            return "mm"
        elif current_unit == 5:
            return "um"

def main():
    extended_xpedition_manager = ExtendedXpeditionManager()

    # Display selected nets
    for net in extended_xpedition_manager.get_selected_nets():
        print('selected net:', net.Name)

    # Display the current unit
    print('unit:', extended_xpedition_manager.get_current_unit())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

### 3. Example for Designer
The following example demonstrates how to use XpeditionManager to list components with a reference designator starting with "R" in the Xpedition Designer environment:
```python
from xpedition_manager import XpeditionManager

manager = XpeditionManager()
manager.initialize_design()

vdapp = manager.design_app
SchematicSheetDocs = vdapp.SchematicSheetDocuments() 
vdview = vdapp.ActiveView 

def findComponentFromCurrentView(alpha):
    components = vdview.Query(128, 0)
    
    for comp in components:
        compResDef = comp.RefDes
        compName = comp.GetName(1)
        print(compName, compResDef)

def main():
    findComponentFromCurrentView('R')
    
if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
