    "We will start by importing the necessary packages for our analysis, including the functions from `cellrake`. Ensure that:\n",

    "1) The algorithm will segment the images to extract all the possible cells, which correspond to bright regions on the image.\n",
    "2) You will be prompted with the segmentations, and you'll have to label them as positive or negative. For each of them, you must type `1` if it is positive or `0` if not. If you run the code in VSCode, the user prompt will appear in the upper part of the screen (close to the VSCode search bar).\n",

    "CellRake's training algorithm is an **active learning** strategy known as [**uncertainty sampling**](https://towardsdatascience.com/active-learning-overview-strategies-and-uncertainty-measures-521565e0b0b), in which you'll progressively label more data until there is no more improvement in the model. This procedure ensures that the model will have an optical performance while labelling the minimum amount of data.\n",

    "By default, the `train` function uses a pipeline composed of a standardization function, a PCA, and a [**support vector machine**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html) (`svm`) optimized through a random search. Other architectures are also available based on [**logistic regressions**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) (`logreg`) and [**random forests**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) (`rf`). For more information, type `help(train)`, `help(train_svm)`, `help(train_logreg)`, and `help(train_rf)`.\n",
