    "# Analyzing images\n",
    "This notebook will build on what we did in the training notebook. First, let us consider the following experiment: We have a group of TRAP2 mice, and we are interested in studying whether the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is involved in two different behavioral tasks. To do so, we induced the expression of tdTomato fluorescent protein in TRAP2 mice by injecting 4OH-tamoxifen during the first behavioral task, labeling the cells activated during this period. After a week of expression, we performed the second different behavioral task, perfused the mice, and performed immunological labeling of cFos protein expression. We took photos of the BLA with a fluorescent microscope, segmented the BLA region, and saved the TIFF images in the folders `tdt` and `cfos`.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will start by importing the necessary packages for our analysis, including the functions from `cellrake`. Ensure you have correctly installed `cellrake` in your Conda environment following the instructions in [README.md](../README.md) and that you are running this notebook with this environment (top right corner of the notebook if you are using VSCode)."
